a little, finicky Jawa~
A finicky Jawa stands at the field's edge watching takeoffs.
~
Standing here is a Jawa, whom, like all of his folk is vertically
challenged. Coming only shortly above the knee on most humans. He is
rapped in a dark brown, hooded sand cloth robe and the only feature
visible from within are his brightly bioilluminescent eyes. He chitters
endlessly and seemingly without sense but if one were to listen long
enough a talker like this could be a fountain of information.

Giant, Wind Torn Clearing~
This wide open gravel lot acts as a go between landing pad for smaller
ships with their payloads of smuggled goods and armed-to-the-teeth bounty
hunters. Skirting your vision in all directions except due west hazy red
mesas, mountains and jagged spires of stone make themselves roughly
visible on the skyline. Northward a trail of pilots turned pedestrian
stream in and out of the sprawling city of Mos Eisley to do their night's
injustice or, coming the other direction to escape retribution. The air is
filled with swirling red, gritty and near opaque silt as the occasional

On the Outskirts of Mos Eisley~
Sandwiched between two slowly graduating conical towers of aerodynamic
design the foot traffic milling between the ship-filled clearing to the
south and the packed streets northward the press of the crowd is
oppressive. The sweet, sour smell of Bantha dung taints the clouds of
spice reaking smoke that drift occasionaly past. The small hooded figures
of the Jawa slip in and out of the crowd of "tourists" from the space port
on their unguessable, individual intents. The cries of good old fashioned
hawkers compete with mechanical voices spit out over encased speakers at
the sides of merchandise stands covered in blinking lights northward.

A Shallow Rut of a Path - At the edge of a Bazaar~
This path, while devoid of the pomp and frivolous wealth of those perusing
Slavers' way to the west but the Jawa population seems to have tripled.
The small furry creatures scurry past with rodent like claws filled with
electrical components or salvage. The Bazaar eastward looks like a
low-tech engineers' fantasy, sporting a wide range of goodies that only a
tech-head could love. This path is nothing more than a rut dug into the
red silt ground by ages of pedestrian traffic.

The Beginnings of a Long, Bustling Road~
The foot traffic collides in this intersection and seems to roll back on
itself like the tides of a human sea. All bedecked with neon obscenities,
flahbulb fantasies and the glinting coin slots. The rich, as one of the
few constants in the galaxy seem nonplussed by the general state of
poverty and hold their noses up high on the way to the nearest dealer in
frivolty along the road northward. Huge, slathering Hutts make their way
past on low flying swoops or meander along through the slavers' markets
and auctioning blocks. Off in the distance to the west the outline of an
old cargo ship dry-docked and abandoned on its side scars the already
unimpressive cityscape. Along a thinning trail to the east commoners of
all walks of life make their way into a small, out of the way bazaar.

An Overpopulated Traders' Bazaar~
This Bazaar is almost exclusively the racket of the Jawa judging by their
huddled forms everywhere, on plain wood stands filled with all manners of
technical equipment.  Sandcloth tarps hung between the buildings overhead
keep the sun from blistering those perusing the wares as well as holding
back the buffeting wind and sand. West the walls of the towering sandstone
buildings give way slightly and leave a stretch of rutted path to adjoin
with the main road near the hover lot southward.

Before the Imperial Garrison~
Saddled in between a forest of buildings larger than itself on all but one
side, this garrison seems shabby but not without malice - Born beside the
door: An Imperial emblem is displayed on blackened durasteel, a meter in
diameter. There does not seem to be an overly militaristic presence in
this building, excluding the occasional stormtrooper passing by, it is a
place of political focus, filled with clerks and protocol droids. The Jawa
market opens up to the south looking more like a scrap heap than not.

A Cluttered, Imperial Garrison Office~
Standing inside this giant cubicle of a work space for Imperial
desk-jockeys, an overwhelming hum of activity comes to those with audial
enhancement: Data banks hum gently to themselves on long rows, covering
each wall. The floors and siding are all done in a standard white
duraplast, looking a little run down and even sagging in places. There are
multiple weapon racks and cots to be seen through a small portal into a
back room.

Slavers' Way~
This road, aptly dubbed by the Huttese, Slavers' way in a time forgotten by
most of the residents is a straight shot north through Mos Eisley. The
poverty which this city seemed so infused with at it's outskirts is
completely out of sight here, hidden by giant red towers and on a more
personal level - Mechanical vendors of every make and model, extending
from plastic display racks and squabbling amongst each other for the
attention of passers-by. To the west a small, offset circle between two
towers acts as a temporary shelter for what seems to be a water
dispensary. Further to the west, and a bit north a dry-docked freighter
abandoned on its side scars the cityscape while northward this circus of
mechanical market influence trails off as far as the eye can see.

and Slavers' Way is packed regardless of the hour, almost without
exception. West the thin lane cramped with with gamblers, alcoholics and
sex maniacs heading toward the freighter in the distance, which, judging
at this distance could only be a casino. Off in a crook of the road a
milling crowd of the big losers and chain smoking bounty hunters loiter in
front of a place of business which proclaims itself, "The Cantina"

the presence of mind to lock away a few gallons of the lifeblood of all

rocky and bits of glass scatter it. There is an almost ceaseless line

spice pipes and some of those Hutt's with the more deplorable tastes in
victuals and less influence (anything goes with enough cred) loaf about
eating live animals and drinking glasses with eyeballs or the sort
drifting about inside. The few droids who make the attempt to shoulder or
roll their ways through the crowd are quickly and silently expelled.

At a Sprawling Bar, Before the Stage~
The focal point of this section of this tavern is of course the sprawling,
high polish durasteel bar. A few of the patrons whom are still capable of
vertical motion are trying their hand at dancing before the stage, looking
like a bunch of drunken, tone deaf zombies for the most part. While the
more prudent customers, not seeing fit to waste their time encircle the
bartender or, as an order of business - in the apalling line before the
restroom of in a corner to the southwest.

This worn looking bar sits a solid two meters above the bar's dance floor
It's durasteel surface has been worn down over generations of dancers
pounding away on its slicked surface. The stage is dimly lit and smoky,
being elevated to the rest of the bar.  Most of the patrons seem jaded to
the band's presence and watch either not at all or with a glazed, "Wish I

The white tile walls in this cold, one man bathroom would appear seamless

on the tavern main while your surroundings press in a bit just to
emphasise their grotesque nature, maggots squirm their way through half
eaten sandwiches and unidentifiable feces while cigarette butts of all the
rainbow's colors lend to the aroma. Finger nail clippings and flesh
residue, chewing gum and splattered bits of rust brown paint.. Blood? Tiny
flecks of the rust red blood trace across the ceiling, probably from some
stim junkie tying off.

B'Omarr Lane - At the Foot of a Drydocked Freighter~
B'omarr lane, as this small cut over path between Slavers' and the massive
eyesore of a cargo freighter lain on its side in the red sands southward
has been dubbed. Named after an order of monks rumoured to inhabit this
rock by the land developers who've long since gave up the monks' task.
"The Lucky Despot" proclaims a four meter tall sign filled with blinking
red bulbs on the ship's hull. A small facade has been built onto the side
of the Despot's entrance, all red, stubbly carpeting and faux gold paint.
Faded red, artificial velvet ropes guide the patrons in and out of the
despots tiny entrance, herding them into easy reach of those collecting
door fees as well as leading directly past the array of digital slot
machines inside.

Through the facade the real nature of the casino makes itself apparent. Not
through the various gambling machines, prostitutes or dealers which, all
scream their various occupation. But by the massive bulkhead showing from
the inside. This whole chamber is the cargo deck on the freighter, covered
in faux gold paint and loose woven shag carpet. A good distance off
through the crowds to the southwest a consierge's desk is apparent while
to the north door fees are charged and the line proceeds inward like some
multisplined, armored back insectoid.

The Lucky Despot - Casino~
This massive, gilt and carpeted room is nothing more than the cargo
compartment on an old freighter. Packed with drunks, gamblers and whores,
the only contenders in this rat race who seem to be turning a profit are
the coin guzzling slot machines. Large Whiphid's in pressed suits wanders
about trying to look inconspicuous as they survey business and make sure
noone does _too_ much winning. Off to the southwest the concsierge's desk
is apparent while the bulkhead lies northwest.

Inside an Antiquated Lift~
This old, faux gold finished lift has a genuine steel grating salvaged from
some nearly prehistoric time. There is a panel of buttons controlling the
lift yet they are all cemented in place and replaced with a more up to
date voice recognition system. The carpet is worn to the point of being
pointless from the countless creatures to wander over it.

Twin Towers Apartment Complex~
These towers actually act as an odd sort of paradox in terms, not to
mention architectural design. Sure, one could argue that a tower built ten
stories into the ground is less appealing than one above but the designers
of this misgnomer were not entirely unfounded in their ideas, it is one of
the oldest buildings on Mos Eisley, untouched by the savage wind swept
sands and stray blaster fire that so love to frequent this province. This
one, above ground floor is more like a bunker than an apartment complex's
entrance and acts only to syphon off the inflow of traffic to the
turbolifts at the ends of each fork in the hall.

quietly as they go about their business of transportation.

A Gut Wrenching Turbolift~
This utilitarian box of a turbolift has a very simple function and performs
it with no second guessing or discussion, up or down. A microphone
(running indepently of the lift's processor's it would have you know if
its ego were properly developed) Will relay the vocal commands of any
occupants with relative ease and in a timely fashion, no less - To the
turbolift. In english? Say the name of the floor you wish to visit and
give thanks to the system which created such a simple piece of equipment.

The Black Pawn~
This tiny shop is stuffed to capacity with a wild collection of guns,
drugs, blades and car parts - It's a wonder this Toydarian keeps his life
of crime so well beneath the Imperial's nose. One with keen eyes could see
the garrison from the front door yet he is entirely unperturbed. The smell
of cordite and rocket fuel, singed plasma bolts and magnetic radiation,
heated metal all fill the air like a foul incense. Back to the west the
Jawa market opens up with all it's wonders.

A Nearly Abandoned Motor Pool~
This tiny, out of the way motor pool is offered meager protection from the
desert winds by barricades built of duraplast barrels woven between
stakes. Gritty red sand piles up in miniature dunes, making a good attempt
at burying everything here as the sand pours in over the barricades in a
slow hourglass. Most of the ships and vehicles parked around look to have
been salvaged although a few ATV's and rusting droids have been spared by
the yard owner for auction. Off to the west the duraplast walls open up on
a giant clearing, bustling with activity of all sorts.

Before a Utilitarian Bunker~
This tiny duracrete lot acts as home for what must be the smallest bunker
in existance. Below two meters in diameter and a third of that is clearly
taken up by reinforced wall. The pill that stands inside is quite simply a
meat propulsion system. Transportation at its most economic. This lot,
while looking to have once been in decent upkeep, is in quite a horrible
form of disrepair. Sand has damaged the once new walls, and foot traffic
is nonexistant.  In fact, were it possible to go to the opposite of the
spectrum - This one would do quite nicely, pedestrians seem to avoid it
like a rutting Gran.

This tiny, pill shaped chamber while bearing great weight on air along
holds little care for beauty. A discrete holo-recorder sits at the point
of the ceiling, a crowded two and a half meters above. While humanoids
would be hard pressed to get around themselves to push the call button. It
might be more prudent to do with another body part. The interior is all
finished to a high glossy black while the floor is made up of some
utilitarian rubber slip guard.

A Dismal, Stuffy Reception Hall~
The walls in this tiny hole of an office, which, by the way seems totally
out of place in this setting, are lined with meaningless trophies and
certificates for some company that most intelligent sources would tell you
does not exist. Nonetheless they boldly maintain their front in all
aspects but one, everything in this office is devoid of life, from the
tidy little paintings of buildings or, alas, mining machinery. A single
thycus, supposedly found only in the depths of Yavin's murk dies slowly of
water starvation in the corner while a human replacement sits passively at
her desk.

A Short, Ebony Buttressed Hall~
This walls of this cramped hallway push inward with ebony inlays and odd
scrimshaw, mostly depicting battle, however on occasion, drawn more
vaguely scenes of torture and mutilation show through. All the victims
bear the lightsaber in one picture or another and are generally depicted
as saintly, and of course to become a saint you must die a martyr. The
black on black detail of everything here makes it a little hard to make
out details in this lighting, next to none. Northward a small front office
sits acting as a guard between the pupils southward and this harsh,
technologized existance.. Yeah, right.

A Dusky, Insular Chamber~
The walls of this massive chamber are all done in the same, engraved ebony
detail while the floor is a little more than a duracrete dip to hold
several inches of water. While it is not deep enough to wet the socks of
most it is considered distasteful to walk across as can be seen in the
occasional, floating passer-by. The water casts an eerie, reflected light
off the walls, exposing like a flashbulb at times a grim scene on the
walls or an archaic gargoyle sitting high up by the vaulted, black mosaic
ceiling. This room seems more of a focusing chamber or temple than what
should rightfully be kept ten stories under the ground. Just to the south
a small, risen platform sits in an inch and a half of somewhat murky
water.

walls or an archaic gargoyle sitting high up by the vaulted, black mosaic
ceiling. This room seems more of a focusing chamber or temple than what
should rightfully be kept ten stories under the ground. Just to the south
a small, risen platform sits in an inch and a half of somewhat murky
water.

A Dusky, Insular Chamber~
The walls of this massive chamber are all done in the same, engraved ebony
detail while the floor is a little more than a duracrete dip to hold
several inches of water. While it is not deep enough to wet the socks of
most it is considered distasteful to walk across as can be seen in the
occasional, floating passer-by. The water casts an eerie, reflected light

A Stone Slab in the Center of the Vaulted Chamber~
The corners of this stone plate curl up several inches and are slotted
almost unnoticably, although the purpose here is obvious. Drainage.
However, what they hope to drain.. Is guessable, rust brown tracks trail
through black tiled grooves to the slots and let a faint smell of
deteriorating flesh taint the air. Cool, artificial moss covers the cobble
and meditation stones for what little comfort it affords in this cold
stone hall. Off to the east the dorms are visible while southward the
sounds of a feed can be heard. In the very peak of the vaulted ceiling,
directly above this slab is an indiscrete, black on black opening, about
as big around as a man.

Nny's Humble Abode~
This hovel, which seemed so shabby and small from the outside seems doubly
shabby and small from the inside. The floors are made up of rotting oak
planks, poorly spaced in a way that would let a careless fellow lose a
foot between them. The house's eyes, shuttered by rotting planks and sewn
with rusted nails let altogether too few and thin spots of sunlight into
the haunt. The walls are all done in a crumbling white plaster which shows
multiple scores looking unmistakably to be where someone's set fingernails
to it. Bits of tissue and other debris coat the floor; a whole fingernail,
a clump of hair, two teeth sticky bits of pink gum flesh still attached.
The door to the outside world on the south wall, as a constant is firmly
shut.  The plaster of the eastern wall is coated, nay drenched from
ceiling to floor in a sticky, rust brown drying liquid that could only be
blood while odd, inversed indentations make themselves apparent on it's
surface as if it were a silk screen. Impressions of faces in horrid
grimaces of pain along with hands, pushing weakly against the other side
of its surface, clawing for escape.

In the Dusky Steeple~
Above the ground which seems to spin at this height, some odd fifteen
meters below, this steepled, subteranean room is done with almost no
decoration in black oak. Soil pushes slowly through the time tested
timbers in small trails and piles up on the floor to soil the shoes of
even the most decorous passer-by. The floor, while made of the same
slicked surface loses some of its appeal for the height wary in that there
is a two meter hole in the floor able and willing to drop those that are
not cautious. The dark is oppressive in here and various smells assault
your nostrils, obvious is the soil yet something fainter, dry and dusty as
well makes its presence known.

A Sleek Silver Elevator~
You step into the elevator, uncertain of its abilities. It is round and
very slim, the front sliding shut as you enter. The floor is curved and
there is only a small space in which you can stand comfortably.
