1 A~
.                MOVING THROUGHOUT GAME:
                ---------------------------
The game divided into many rooms which are connected by various
directionals to make up areas.  When you are in a room, you can
find the exits in the room by typing EXITS.  Autoexit is a helpful
command to initiate (type CONFIG +AUTOEXIT), because it will
automatically show you what exits there are in the room.  Be warned
however, you will only see the obvious exits.  You must pay attention
to the room descriptions to see if there might be any doors or hidden
passages in the room. 

Directional commands: (in parentheses you find the shorthand)
NORTH (n)    SOUTH (s)    EAST (e)    WEST (w)     UP (u)     DOWN (d)
NORTHEAST (Ne)  NORTHWEST (Nw)  SOUTHEAST (Se)  SOUTHWEST (Sw)
 
Note:  You will notice that in the prompt <20hp 10bp 20mv>, the 'mv'
       refers to your movement points.  If your movement points were
       to run out, you will be unable to move between rooms due to

To save changes permenantly, type "aassign none" and foldarea.
 
Warning!! Do not have an area aassigned to yourself when getting personal
vnums assigned to you.  The personal vnums will overwrite the area file.

area bestowed to you or you must be Greater God+.
 
In order to assign a nonproto area to yourself, you must either have
that area bestowed to you by a member of the Area Council or you must

0 ADARI ADARIAN~
an alien race native to the planet Adari, the Adarians are humanoids with 
unusual cranial structures. Their skulls are elongated and tall, and havea 
large hole which goes completely through it. They have no ears or noses, and 
their mouth is ringed with sharp, bony ridges instead of lips. The Adarians 
make up to the lack of ears with a covering of fine hairs along their skulls 
that pick up the vibration of sound waves. A series of glands near the skin's 
surface allows them to smell. Their throats can be distended and filled with 
air, and the resulting "long call" can be useful as a communication method or a 
kind of defensive action. The Adarians have a rigid caste system which 
dominates their society, and the have evolved an advanced technology based on 
the use of super-cooled carbon-ice computers. They were able to remain neutral 
during the Galactic Civil War by signing a non-agression treaty with the 
Empire, providing the Empire with unlimited raw materials in return for their 
neutrality.

1 'ADVANCED MARTIAL ARTS'~
&GName: &w&WAdvanced Martial Arts

&GFeat Type: &w&WNon-Force Feat

&GRequirements: &w&WMartial Arts, Improved Martial Arts, hitroll +8

&GBenefit: &w&WA Medium-size character deals 3d4 damage with an unarmed strike. Strength modifiers apply. Also,
you threaten a critical hit on a natural 18, 19, or 20 when making an unarmed attack. Small characters
deal 3d3e damage and Large characters deal 3d6 damage with an unarmed strike and this feat.
~

31 ADVANCEDEXITS~
SMAUG supports having more than one exit in the same direction,
as well as the special direction 'somewhere', represented by a '?'.
 
If you already have an exit leading north, and would like another one,
use a plus sign '+' in front of the direction:
redit exit +n 3001          - Adds another exit north to room 3001
 
To modify an extra exit like this, or to remove it, you'll have to
refer to it by number:
redit exit #2 3002          - Change the second exit to go to room 3002
 
To know what number an exit is, do an "rstat".
 
For someone to be able to use the second north exit, you have to set one
of the extra flags (see EXFLAGS) like CAN_CLIMB.  It is also usually a good
idea to set the HIDDEN flag for any special exit so that it looks nicer
with autoexits on.
 
The AUTO flag makes it possible to go in a direction by simply typing the
keyword for that exit:
redit exit ? 3001           - Create a 'somewhere' exit to 3001
redit exflags ? auto hidden - Set the proper flags
redit exname ? swim         - Set the keyword "swim"
If a player types 'swim' in the room, they will move to room 3001.

   Also credit to Ken Wellsch for porting the original Fortran-77 version
   to UNIX-C (over a period of about 3 years) (c)1984.

&gMax Level: &w10

&gDescription: &wBirds fly, insects fly, and airspeeders fly. The aerobat soars, twirls, floats, darts, and flies rings around all
of them. He would rather touch the clouds than stride on land with the pedestrians. The aerobat's love of flying goes beyond 
convenience and evolution. Flight is an intoxicating experience that unleashes another side of the aerobat. The adrenaline rush,
confidence boost, and feeling of complete mastery motivate the aerobat to constantly strive to become better at dodging obstacles,
avoiding attacks, and flying faster than others of his species. Aerobats are typically members of flying species, but they can 
execute maneuvers that would make their winged kin blush with envy.

&gRequirements: &wHitroll 2, Spot 4, Tumble 5, Dodge, Natural Flight Ability

0 AFFECTED 'AFFECTED BY'~
Syntax:  affected       (abbrevation:  af)
Syntax:  affected by    (abbreviation: af by)
 
'Affected' is a powers-at-a-glance function, which displays only the powers
(and skill affects) your character is currently under.  Each affect will be
listed by name only for the sake of brevity (if you want to know what each
is doing, use help <power/skill name> or 'score').
 
Characters level 20 or above and deadly characters will also see the number
of rounds remaining for each affect.  Affects with a remaining lifespan of
less than 25 rounds are displayed in white, and those in immediate danger
of wearing off will flash.
 
'Affected by' displays a character's affects separate from its power/skill
affect list.  This is useful for ensuring that affects given from equipment
are actually functioning.  For example, if you are wearing a visor with
detect_invis but 'affected by' does not show you as having that affect, you
are not detecting invisibility.
 
'Affected by' also displays your current susceptibilities, resistances and
immunities if your character is level 20 or higher.
 
~

31 AFFECTEDBY AFFECTED_BY~
The following are affect flags that can be used when osetting an item

&gDescription: &wMost Anomids drape themselves in long flowing robes and wear vocalizer masks, covering all but their eyes and bald
heads. They are by no means shy, however, and are quick to strike up a conversation with a stranger, especially a member of a
rarely encountered species. They enjoy sharing wild spacers' tales and news from across the galaxy. Anomids are encountered 
throughout the populated sections of the galaxy. The species joined &bThe Republic&w and spent 15,000 years traveling the galaxy,
colonizing worlds, and obtaining new technology. What they can't develop themselves, they buy &g(&wusually through legitimate
means&g)&w. As Anomids lack vocal cords, they rely on vocalizer masks to synthesize speech. The masks translate their jaw and
throat muscle movements into harsh, electronically synthesized words.

&gPersonality: &wAnomids are peaceful intellectuals. They are intensely curious about cultures across the galaxy. They often seize
the opportunity to meet beings of species they've never encountered before, taking care to learn their customs and etiquette.
Anomids usually avoid physical confrontations.

&gPhysical Description: &wA typical Anomid is frail-looking, with translucent skin, large opalescent eyes, a bald pate surrounded
by dark wispy hair, six-fingered hands, and fanlike ears. Adult Anomids average 1.75 meters tall.

0 'ANTARIAN RANGER'~
&gName: &wAntarian Ranger

&gClass Type: &wNon-Force Clan-Specific Prestige Class

&gMax Level: &w 5

&gDescription: &wThe life of an Antarian Ranger is not an easy one, and only the most dedicated and the most fit for the position
thrive within the organization. Very few members of the Antarian Rangers actually earn the coveted rank of Ranger, as most become
the support personnel for this elite group. This prestige class represents true Rangers. The Rangers are trained to be the masters
of any terrain; they must be stealthy, observant, and capable if they are to assist the Jedi in the field. Upon reaching the rank
of Range, members are typically assigned to a certain sector and, in some cases, to a particular Jedi who has requested their
services. Not having a set uniform, Rangers are rewarded with a distinctive brown leather jacket reminiscent of those worn by
off-duty members of sector defense forces.

&gRequirements: &wHitroll +7, Move Silently 6, Spot 6, Survival 8, Members Within The Antarian Rangers Clan

&gHitpoints: &wAn Antarian Ranger gains 1-8 hitpoints per level. The character's Constitution applies.

~

0 'ANTARIAN RANGERS'~
&gName: &wAntarian Rangers

&gOgranization Type: &wParamilitary Organization

&gDescription: &wThe Antaraian Rangers are a unique paramilitary organization of non-Force-users who, unlike many citizens of the
galaxy, do not fear the power of the Jedi and actively assist them whenever possible. The Antarian Rangers dedicate their lives 
to acting as support troops for the Jedi, and are deployed in reconnaissance and covert operations to make the work of the Jedi
easier. Often tasked with doing what some would consider the "dirty work," the Rangers are tread by the Jedi Council with indifferance.
The opinions of individual Jedi vary, however, and many work closely with them and truly value their service.

&gLeaving The Antarian Rangers: &wThe Antarian Rangers can ill afford losses, even at the height of the organization's membership.
Never a large faction, the Rangers value the services of each and every member, and go out of their way to keep members in the fold.
Though retirement and discharges as a result of injury are both acceptable, simply leaving the organization without good reason
is viewed as desertion. Despite this, the Antarian Rangers will not stop a member from leaving if he persists on parting ways.
Like any other paramilitary organization, the Rangers are concerned about the organization's secrets, and they take steps to 
eliminate the problem if an ex-member is revealing more than she should. Leaving the Rangers to become a member of the Jedi Order,
rare a case as it may be, is seen as an exceptional honor, and anyone who does so receives a fond farewell from the other members.

it develops logic subroutines that tell it to circumvent its problems through violence. The droid acts out its violent urges against

requirements of organic beings that provoked the droid in the first place. Berserker droids are not necessarily homicidal maniacs.
They can be quite rational and sometimes even caring. They are simply designated berserker droids because, when they feel threatened,
they do not react according to factory presets &g- &wthey react with focused and effective violence. Nearly any sort of droid can
become a berserker droid. Protocol droids seem to be a common type, though this may have more to do with their ubiquitous nature
and constant contact with living beings more than any inherent susceptibility. Berserker droids have been known to absorb lethal
amounts of damage and still tenaciously tear their enemies apart &g- &wquite an advantage when they have allies who are willing
to restore them back to operational condition afterward.

&gName: &wBlack Sun Enforcer

&gClass Type: &wNon-Force Clan-Specific Prestige Class

&gMax Level: &w5

&gDescription: &wThough the existence of Black Sun is officially just a myth, the criminal syndicate occasionally needs to make its
presence known. The enforcers of Black Sun frequently provide a public face, even though they never mention Black Sun or any of its
leaders by name. Black Sun's enforcers conduct the day-to-day business of ensuring that their particular brand of organized crime
stays organized. When someone gets out of line, when someone gets too inquisitive, or when a message needs to be sent, Black Sun
sends an enforcer to do the dirty work. Black Sun's more intelligent &g(&wor luckier&g)&w associates never have to talk to an enforcer
more than once in their lifetimes. Despite the overall secrecy of the Black Sun criminal syndicate, its enforcers tend to cultivate
frightening reputations &g-&w even though the average citizen has no idea who the enforcer's employer might be. Rumors abound of
enforcers who have thrown troublesome individuals into canyons, or who have dismembered inquisitive journalists.

collectively oversee Black Sun's operations in a variety of illegal industries and endeavors, from smuggling to political 
assassinations, all the while posing as legitimate businesspersons. The vigos answer only to their leader, and in return for their
service and loyalty they are rewarded with power, luxury, and fabulous amounts of treasure. Should a vigo fail Black Sun &g(&wor
threaten the power of their leader&g)&w, the vigo is rewarded with a swift but excruciating death. The roster of Black Sun vigos,
not surprisingly, changes rather frequently. To ensure a long life, a vigo must be profitable and effective, while simultaneously
being without ambition &g-&w at least, where the leader is concerned. Of course, such an individual must also measure how ardently
he supports the leader, or prince. Despite all of their power, the various leaders of Black Sun have never learned the secret of
living forever &g-&w and siding too loyally with one prince may be a fatal black mark in the next one's book.

&gRequirements: &wDiplomacy 10, Intimidate 10, Influence, Darkpoints 5, Reputation 4, Black Sun Leader, Number1 or Number2

&gHitroll: &wA Black Sun vigo gains 1-6 hitpoints per level. The character's Constitution applies.

0 'BLACK SUN' BLACKSUN~
&gName: &wBlack Sun Crime Syndicate

&gOrganization Type: &wUnderworld Crime Syndicate

&gDescription: &wAnyone who says that the Hutts are a leading example of organized crime has never heard of Black Sun. Black Sun
differs from the Hutt Criminal Syndicate chiefly in that, not being a sovereign state, it operates covertly. Black Sun deals in
information, much like the Bothan Spynet, but Black Sun acquires it in a much more aggressive and ruthless fashion. Through blackmail,
coercion, intimidation, and sometimes assassination, Black Sun learns what others would rather keep secret &g-&w then uses those
very same techniques to turn information into credits.

&gLeaving The Black Sun Criminal Syndicate: &wNo one has ever managed to "resign" from Black Sun. Membership is for life, and leaving
Black Sun &g-&w especially following some sort of transgression &g-&w is effectively a request for execution. Some members have
tried to run and hide, only to discover that Black Sun's agents can find and kill nearly anyone, nearly anywhere. The only way to
survive seperation from Black Sun is to contract a debilitating illness or injury &g-&w unpleasant options at best. Otherwise,
one can best hope to make a suitable living from Black Sun for as long as possible, and eventually die quietly in one's sleep.

1 CALLFORCE~
&GTopic: &w&WCallforce

&GSyntax: &w&WCallforce
        Callforce <Light/Dark>

&GDescription: &w&WWhen a character with the Force-Sensitive feat spends a Force Point, the character MUST declare
whether he is calling upon the light or the dark side of the Force (characters without the Force-Sensitive feat
don't make this declaration). In most cases, calling upon the dark side of the Force is done out of desparation
or anger, however, some individuals learn to rely on this power - that is, until it controls them. Dark characters
will always call upon the dark side of the Force, regardless of if they input light as an argument. Calling upon
the Force grants a character a temporary bonus to Hitrolls. The bonus granted is determined by the character's 
level, his Force-Sensitive status, and (if Force-Sensitive) whether he calls upon the light side or the dark side 
of the Force for aid.

0 CARGO BUYCARGO SELLCARGO LISTCARGO DUMPCARGO PIRATE SCANSHIP~
&wThe key to drastically increasing the economy of any planet is to increase exports. Large freighters carrying a variety
of cargo litter popular trade lanes. Unfortunitly where there are traders, there are pirates. Ships dropping out of hyperspace,
attacking freighters with ion cannons, lifting cargo, and disappearing just as quickly as they came, have caused a great demand
for mercenary guards to guard transports. The follow describe the commands used to buy/sell cargo, as well as to pirate cargo
from other traders.

&rBuycargo&w - Used in shops, this command enables a player to purchase cargo and have it delivered to his/her ship.
&rSellcargo&w - Used again in special shops, this command enables a player to sell cargo to a new planet.

Before you can use a force power, you have to practice it.  The more you

be force sensitive and have enough force energy to use the powers.

The <target> is optional.  Many powers which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the power name is more than one word, then you must quote the power name.
Example: feel 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word powers.
You can abbreviate the power name.

0 CEREAN~
&gName: &wCerean

&gDescription: &wCereans are a sophisticated and cultured humanoid species that originated on Cerea, a world on the fringes of known
space. Their elongated heads distinguish them from most other humanoid species. The Cereans swiftly gained galactic fame as expert
astrogators, cryptographers, and economists. Few patters or trends, no matter how convoluted or obscure, escape the notice of a 
Cerean. The peaceful philosophies of the &bJedi&w appeal to Cereans, and those who long for adventure find the tenets and ways
of the &bJedi Order&w very alluring.

&gPersonality: &wCereans tend to be calm, rational, and extremely logical.

&gPhysical Description: &wCereans average 2 meters tall and have a similar build to Humans. Their elongated craniums house complex
binary brains that enable them to process information and solve problems rapidly. Cereans also have two hearts beating in their
chests.

&gHomeworld: &wCerea, a blissful planet located in the Mid Rim.

0 CHAGRIAN~
&gName: &wChagrian

&gDescription: &wChagrians are powerfully built amphibian humanoids that are equally comfortable on land and in water, something
that is reflected both in their architecture and in their culture. Early in the evolutionary stages of life on Champala, the
system's sun went through an unstable period and bombarded its orbiting bodies with massive amounts of radiation. Only species 
that developed an ability to withstand the radiation survived. The Chagrians were among those species, and their skin &g-&w which
ranges in color from light blue to deep indigo&g -&w continues to provide them with remarkable natural protection from radiation
of all kinds.

&gPersonality: &wChagrians are law-abiding and even-tempered. The species has always known abundance, so greed and avarice are
uncommon traits among them. Chagrians prefer to live in cosmopolitan areas, where they can interact with other people and species.

&gPhysical Description: &wChagrians have blue skin. Males and females both have a pair of horns, known as "&Ylethorns&w," protruding
from fleshy growths on their heads. Lethorns can become quiet large and can be draped over their shoulders. Males have a second
pair of horns sprouting from the tops of their heads; these sharp horns were once used to battle for mates, but now they serve
only as a source of vanity. Males and females of the species both stand between 1.7 and 2.2 meters tall.

&gHomeworld: &wThe water world of Champala in the Chagri system, a favorite vacation spot among the Inner Rim worlds.

&gSpecies Traits: &w+2 Strength, -2 Dexterity
                Medium-Sized
                Can't Drown In Water
                +4 Species Bonus To &rSwim&w Checks

BlasTech, Kuat Drive Yards, Rothana Heavy Engineering, and Baktoid Combat Automata would not be as successful or powerful as they
are without the intellect and ingenuity of the engineers who produce the designs. Chief engineers are not restricted to working in
design labs or shipyards, however. Some of the best and brightest engineers in the galaxy work for outlaw groups, or ply their
wares on the streets of Nar Shaddaa. They work with special forces troops to sabotage enemy infrastructures or design new starfighters
for wealthy pirate groups. Chief engineers use their knowledge of the way things are put together to more effectively take measures
or whip up special weapons for field troops in dangerous situations. Many chief engineers spend their days testing and experimenting
with new designs and technologies.

1 CONSTITUTION CON~
Constitution (CON in your 'score') represents your character's physical
stamina.  Among other things, it affects:
 
 - the number of hitpoints recovered or regenerated at each tick if
   resting or sleeping

1 'CONTAINERS' 'CONTAINER'~
Containers are almost a necessity in the game.  They are used to carry
items, food, and drinks.  They help allow you to sort things, by using two
or more types of containers at once.  Corpses use many of the same commands
as regular containers.

EXAM <container> or LOOK IN <container> allows you to see what it contains.

GET <item> <container> allows you to take one item from a container.
GET ALL <container> allows you to take everything from a container at once.
GET ALL.<item> <container> allows you to take all of a particular item type

PUT <item> <container> puts an item inside a container.

assassin, this command allows you to privately hire killers
to take out your target. Your target must be online, and you
MUST have IC reason to kill him, meaning you must get an imms
authorization before contracting. You also pay your contract
in advance, so if that player does not kill your target, your

There are three levels of government: 1. ORGANIZATIONS: The major player
run superpowers are the New Repubic, The Empire, and The Corperate
Authority. There are also several small organizations and crime families
operating independantly. Type CLANS for a list. 2. regional GOVERNMENTS:
These are small areas that may be controlled and profited from by player
organizations. They may be captured by organizations with the capture
command. Type GOVERNMENTS for a list. 3. The SENATE: The senate was
restored by the New republic shortly after the battle of Endor. It has
since then broken off its direct ties with the New Republic in order to
include the council heads from all worlds including Imperial controlled
worlds. The senate meets monthly at the traditional senate hall on
coruscant. However because of the difficulty that imperials face flying
near coruscant a shuttle has been set up that provides safe transportation
from a nuetral outpost to the Senate hall. The senate hall also has a
series of opinion booths were council heads can comunicate with their
people. These opinion booths are also used for electing new council heads.
Type SENATE for a list of senators.

1 COVER DUCK DUCKING~
&wTaking cover behind objects enables a character to minimize the risk of taking hits at the cost of being less efficient
during combat. While taking cover behind objects or ships, a character may lean left or right to better aim at his/her
targets. A character may only take cover if there is a suitable object or a ship in the same room. Otherwise you may optimize
the Duck command. The causes a character to crouch down, making him/her self a smaller target.
~

0 COYNITE~
the fierce, warrior race which was native to the planet Coyn, the Coynites
stand nearly three meters tall. Their bodies are covered with fine fur,
which ranged in color from white or gold to brown and black. Their heads
were crowned by a  mane of longer hair, and the length of the mane
indicated the individual's social status. Coynites are natural warriors,
and almost always wear some form of battle armor and weapon.
Xenobiologists have guessed that the average Coynite  could live to be 250
standards years old, but most males died in combat by the time they were
55. They hold to a rigid system of ritual and honor codes known as the
En'Tra'Sol, that governed not only battle but politics. Offworlders have 
been killed for not adhering to this code. The Coynites respected and
admired the Jedi Knights of the Old Republic, since the Jedi Code was
similar to the En'Tra'Sol in many respects.

0 'CRIME BROKER'~
&gName: &wCrime Broker

&gClass Type: &wNon-Force Clan-Specific Prestige Class

&gMax Level: &w5

&gDescription: &wCrime brokers are disreputable scum who arrange illegal acts for those who wish to retain some level of anonymity
or deniability. Not quite crime lords, crime brokers operate on a smaller scale, bringing clients together with contractors, or
acting as a go-between to see that some crime is committed &g- &wfor a percentage of the fee. There aren't a lot of credits in 
crime brokering, unfortunately, because crime brokers frequently have a crime lord patron who expects a significant cut. On the
other hand, a lowly crime broker doesn't have nearly the same overhead &g- &wnor does he draw so many assassination attempts &g- &was
his crime lord employer. Even so, many crime brokers go on to become crime lords, lured by the wealth and prestige. Most crime
brokers go completely unnoticed by the general public; only those who need an illegal service take the trouble to find a crime
broker. They advertise almost solely by word of mouth &g(&w"I know a Rodian who knows a Zabrak who knows a Hutt..."&g)&w and, as might
be expected, must be careful with whom they do business, and where. If caught by the authorities, a crime broker can expect a short
prison term, since the most he's usually guilty of is acting as an accessory. A crime broker can expect a short prison term,

0 'CRIME LORD'~
&gName: &wCrime Lord

&gClass Type: &wNon-Force Prestige Class

&gMax Level: &w10

&gDescription: &wFrew societies manage to eradicate crime altogether. In the underworld, someone always rises to the top, either
through vision, organization, or sheer intimidation. The life of a crime lord isn't for the timid. After conquering an unseen empire,
the crime lord wages a daily struggle not only to stay on top, but also to stay alive. Of course, not every crime lord is bent on
corrupting society and making a profit. Some use their criminal connections to wage lucrative guerilla wars against tyrants and
despots. Problematically, crime lords are notoriously bad at cooperating with one another. The head of any given criminal empire has
as much to fear from a gang war as he does from internal dissent and ambitious underlings. Even those with altruistic intentions
sometimes learn the hard way that their troops are more interested in gaining power and wealth than saving the galaxy from greater
evils.

&gRequirements: &wDiplomacy 8, Gather Information 8, Reputation 2, Infamy Feat

&gHitpoints: &wCrime lords gain 1-6 hitpoints per level. The character's Constitution applies.

0 'DARK FORCE WITCH'~
&gName: &wDark Force Witch

&gClass Type: &bForce &wPrestige Class

&gMax Level: &w10

&gDescription: &wOn all-but-forgotten primitive worlds, where the strong survive by preying upon the weak, those gifted with the
Force are the strongest of all. Isolated from the formalized training of the Jedi and the Sith, Force-users on these worlds have
developed traditions all their own &g- &wtraditions that depend upon the dark side. To become a dark Force witch, a character must
immerse herself not only in the dark side of the Force, but in the traditions and rituals of her primitive culture. If the character
can survive those savage customs long enough, she might glean the knowledge necessary to join the ranks of the dark Force witches.
The path of the dark Force witch is faught with brutality. She is encouraged to dominate her environment, imposing her will on
everything weaker while constantly testing the power and resolve of everything stronger. A witch advances in prestige by exerting
her influence and defending her territory &g(&wliterally or figureatively&g)&w. She earns the respect of her sisters by being at
least twice as ruthless. Dark Force witches generally begin their training in some other class &g(&wgenerally as Force adepts, though
fringers and scouts are not uncommon&g)&w, but they are encouraged to develop their Force powers as soon as they can. Violence
and cruelty distinguish their early training. By teaching a Force-strong novice fear and hate, they prepare her for the embrace
of the dark side. Those who fail to learn an equivalent ruthlessness can at best hope to be cast out. More commonly, they don't
survive. Dark Force witches treat all prospective recruits the same way, regardless of their age or experience. To them, only
the strong should survive; the weak are ment to serve. By becoming full-fledged witches, they prove themselves strong.

&gRequirements: &wHitroll +1, Intimidate 2, Move Object 4, Fear 4, Force-Sensitive, Alter, Sense, Darkpoints 4, Reputation 1

&gHitpoints: &wDark Force witches gain 1-8 hitpoints per level. The character's Constitution applies.

0 'DARK SIDE DEVOTEE'~
&gName: &wDark Side Devotee

&gClass Type: &bForce &wPrestige Class

&gMax Level: &w10

&gDescription: &wThe dark side devotee is what the Force adept would have been had he turned to the dark side early on. Pursuing a
different path from the Jedi or even the Sith tradition, he regards the Force as something supernatural, fostering that image in
the minds of others to make himself seem more mysterious and powerful. His belief system may not recognize the Force as the same
tool the Jedi or the Sith use. A dark side devotee begins his training in the Force by taking what he wants from others and 
dominating the world around him, as typified by the Alter feat. Dark side devotees discover their power early in life. Frequently,
they do not care how the Force works, as long as it focuses their hatred and anger against those who have wronged them. What little
training they receive is generally bestowed by more powerful darksiders, who might initally think of the dark side devotee as an
apprentice or even a slave. There are precious few formal traditions for the dark side devotee. Many come from primitive cultures
where they are regarded in awe and terror for their ability to manipulate the environment, and they nurture this belief to exploit
the weak.

&gRequirements: &wHitroll +2, Intimidate 4, Force-Sensitive, Darkpoints 3

&gHitpoints: &wDark side devotees gain 1-8 hitpoints per level. The character's Constitution applies.

0 'DARK SIDE MARAUDER'~
&gName: &wDark Side Marauder

&gClass Type: &bForce &wPrestige Class

&gMax Level: &w10

&gDescription: &wWarriors who discover in themselves an ability to wield the Force can become dark side marauders. Like Jedi guardians,
dark side marauders combine physical prowess with training in the Force. Unlike Jedi, they bend it to their own violent purposes.
Without the mental discliplines and strict code of conduct the Jedi Order provides, these warriors become brutal, living weapons,
delighting in inflicting pain and taking lives. The dark side marauder becomes an extension of the dark side of the Force in the
same way as her weapons are an extension of her body. When violence touches the life of someone strong in the Force, it can change
her forever, especially if she lacks a Jedi mentor to guide her development. If her life is violence &g-&w such as in the case with
warriors &g- &wit is almost a foregone conclusion that she will succumb to the dark side. A dark side marauder might have turned
to the dark side to overcome the horrors of war or the brutality of crime. Few have formal training in the Force, however; they
learn by doing.

&gRequirements: &wHitroll +1, Intimidate 4, Force-Sensitive, Darkpoints 4

&gHitpoints: &wDark side marauders gain 1-10 hitpoints per level. The character's Constitution applies.

&wAlso see &rhelp marauderprof&w for more information.

1 DARKPOINTS~
&GTopic: &w&WDarkpoints

&GDescription: &w&WThe Force has two aspects, one light and one dark. The dark side lurks in the shadows,
whispering to Force-users, tempting them with quick and easy access to power. While seemingly stronger,
the dark side is only easier. It consists of the destructive impulses of all living beings. Anger,
fear, hatred, and aggression are expressions of the dark side, and such emotions can quickly lead a
Force-user down the dark side's corrupting path. Early on in her training, a Force-user finds that
the dark side greatly enhances her abilities. Dark Side Points measure the corrupting influence of
the dark side of the Force. These points gauge a character's devotion - consciously or otherwise -
to the dark side.

&GA character gains Dark Side Points in three ways:
  1.&w&W Using a Force Point to call upon the dark side.
  &G2.&w&W Using a dark side Force-based skill or feat.
  &G3. &w&WPerforming an evil act.

At first, it may seem that the dark side is an easy path to power. Eventually, however, those who
depend on the power of the dark side of the Force fall victim to it. A character achieves the
distinction of falling to the dark side in two stages: tainted and dark. When a character's number of
Dark Side Points equals one-half his Widsom score (rounded down), he is considered to be tainted. A
tainted character is in danger of being lost to the dark side. He has begun to walk its path and taste
the seductive power it offers. Such a character gains bonuses on all dark side Force skills. Thereafter
each time a hero gains a Dark Side Point he must make a Wisdom check (don't worry about it, its done
in the code). If he fails, or when his number of Dark Side Points equals or exceeds his Wisdom score,
he is considered to be dark. His bonus on all dark side Force skills increases. Any Force Points spent
by a dark character, automatically is used to call upon the dark side and thus, he receives another
Dark Side Point.

The long-term effects of the dark side can be quite devistating. Whenever a tainted Force-using character
gains a new level, he or she must check to see if the corruption of the dark side has had a permanent,
lasting effect. To so this, the character makes a Fortitude saving throw. If the save succeeds, the character
manages to stave off the debilitating effects of the dark side for another level. If the save fails, the
character randomly loses one point of strength, dexterity or constitution. The same save is made if a Dark
character gains a level, just at a higher difficulty.

A tainted character may atone for his sins against the Force by meditating. A dark character may not
meditate his Dark Side Points away, this may only be done through role playing out great heroism in the
name of the light side of the Force.

Only characters with the Force-Sensitive feat can accumulate Dark Side Points.

0 DASHADE~
&gName: &wDashade

&gDescription: &wThe Dashade were renowned and feared as deadly mercenaries and assassins. The name "&YShadow Killer&w," an honorary
title given to the most accomplished Dashade killers, was spoken only in whispers and sent involuntary shivers through those
who heard the words. The &bSith&w and a number of other cultures that inhabit star systems near the Cron Cluster use Dashade
mercenaries as bodyguards and assassins. The &bJedi&w and official &bRepublic&w institutions hire Dashade as combat instructors.
Jedi Masters viewed Dashade combat prowess and Force resistance as a means to show Padawans &g(&wand even over-confident Jedi
Knights&g)&w the danger of relying too heavily on their Force abilities in combat.

&gPersonality: &wDashade are secretive, menacing beings who believe they are physically and mentally superior to most &g-&w if not
all &g-&w other sentient lifeforms in the galaxy. Dashade hired as mercenaries and assassins remain loyal to their employers only
so long as they profit from the relationship and are allowed to demonstrate their combat prowess.

&gPhysical Description: &wThe Dashade are hairless humanoids with high foreheads, beady eyes, and lampreylike mouths. Adults of
the species stand between 1.7 and 2 meters tall, with no differeence in height and build between males and females. Their skin
colors are olive green, dark gray, or black, they have orange, red, or black eyes.

0 DEFEL~
&gName: &wDefel

&gDescription: &wDefel originate on Af'El, a high-gravity world. Due to the unusual chemical composition of Af'El's upper atmosphere,
only ultraviolet light passes freely to the surface of the planet, while longer wavelengths of light are completely deflected.
Because of this, all life-forms on Af'El, including the Defel, are completely blind to the non-ultraviolet spectrum. To function
away from their homeworld, Defel must wear special visors that allow them to "see" light wavelengths other than ultraviolet. A
Defel without such a visor is effectively blind in normal light. Defel fur absorbs light wavelengths such that in darkness, a
Defel is invisible even to beings with darkvision. Their unnerving, shadowy appearance in the light makes even those Defel who
aren't skilled combatants useful bodyguards, since few beings are aware of the source of this strange effect.

&gPersonality: &wDefel are proud and independent to the point of stubbornness. They don't like others telling them what to do or
how to do it. They are loyal to their friends and employers, but not always trustworthy. They can be secretive and conniving.

&gPhysical Descriptions: &wThe Defel are a curious mamalian species, appearing as a monsterous bipedal shadow with reddish eyes
and long white fangs. Under ultraviolet light, however, it becomes clear that Defel are stocky beings covered in fur that ranges
from brilliant yellow to dazzling azure. They have long fingers that end in vicious yellow claws and protruding lime-green snouts.
They stand between 1 meter and 1.5 meters tall.

&gHomeworld: &wAf'El, a high-gravity planet orbiting the super-giant Ka'Dedus in the Outer Rim.

&gSpecies Traits: &w-2 Strength, +2 Intelligence

0 DEVARONIAN~
these aliens are one of the most unique races in the galaxy, as their male
and female sexes are so vastly different in appearance and temperament.
The males are docile, non-aggresive creatures with smooth, hairless skin
and short horns  on their heads. They takes great pride in their horns,
and groom them quite regularly. The females, on the other hand, are
covered in calico fur and do not have horns. They are aggressive by
nature, and tend to dominate their culture.  It is believed that they are
descended from a race of primates that lived in the mountains of Devaron,
their homeworld, and that their horns were a genetic mutation that proved
useful in fending off predatory brids. Devaronians are  carnivores and in
general, have an efficient metabolism, consuming nearly every bit of food
they eat. Devaronians were one of the first races to discover the secrets
to space travel and develop stardrives.

                     Additional contributions from:

 Michael Curran  - the player title collection and additional locations.
 Bill Wisner     - for being the first to successfully port the game,
                   uncovering several old bugs, uh, inconsistencies,
                   in the process.

         And: Mads Haar and Stephan Dahl for additional locations.

0 DRALL~
&gName: &wDrall

&gDescription: &wThe Drall are mild-mannered, short humanoids. As a species, they are methodical researchers, careful observers,
and considered among the best theoretical thinkers in the galaxy. Although well-versed in virtually every widely used technology
in the galaxy, and often numbered among scientists who are on the cutting edge in a number of fields, Drall are primarily
interested in abstract concepts and accumulating knowledge for the sake of knowledge. Therefore, despite the advanced nature
of their scholarly pursuits, the world of Drall trails behind the rest of the galaxy in technological achievement, and the Drall
themselves usually implement technology developed by others. Drall society is a clan-based combination of a matriarchy and a
meritocracy. No elected or direct hereditary leaders exist on the Drall homeworld. Instead, each family heeds a "Duchess," a
female Drall who is deemed the most fit to lead. Once appointed, the Duchess becomes the owner of all the family's property,
and she holds the position for life or until she steps down and passes the title and property along to a suitable heir.

&gPersonality: &wDrall take pride in being viewed as well mannered and considerate. They are also intelligent, reasonable, and
difficult to anger. Drall are scrupulously honest in their business dealings, and if they promise to perform a task for a
certain payment, they always do so to the best of their ability. They expect others to behave in a similar fashion.

&gPhysical Description: &wDrall have short muzzles and almond-shaped black eyes. Their bodies are covered in fur that ranges from
brown and black to reddish-gray. They have short limbs and clawed hands and feet. They tend not to wear clothing, although both
males and females often wear elaborate necklaces, headdresses, and other types of jewelry. Adult Drall stand between 0.9 and
1.5 meters tall, with most females being taller and more solidly built then males.

&gHomeworld: &wThe Core World of Drall, in the Corellia system.

&gSpecies Traits: &w-2 Strength, -2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom, +2 Charisma

0 DROID~
&gName: &wDroid

&gDescription: &wDroids are usually property, bought and sold like any other piece of equipment. Although some droid owners come
to think of their droids as freinds, the fact remains that droids are programmed to serve whoever is designated as their master.
Occasionally, events conspire to lead a droid to independence. These so-call "self-owned" droids are few, but not as rare as
many believe.

&gClassifications Of Droids: &wThere are currently 5 different Droid types.

  &gFirst-Degree: &wEffectively mobile computers. They are programmed to solve scientific problems quickly and accurately and put
   those solutions to effective use. Example: 2-1B Medical Droid and 1T-O Interrogation Droid.
    -2 Strength, +2 Intelligence, -2 Charisma

  &gSecond-Degree: &wTheir main function is complex equations specifically relating to engineering and technical sciences. They're
   generally equipped with appendages that allow them to interact with other machines. Example: R2 Series Astromech Droids.
   -4 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence

  &gThird-Degree: &wProgrammed to perform social services: translation, protocol, teaching, housekeeping, and secretarial work. Many
   are also programmed to act as controllers of complex systems. Example: 3PO Protocol Droid and M-TD Series Translator Droid.
   -2 Strength, -2 Wisdom, +2 Charisma

  &gFourth-Degree: &wNearly all employed in security or military applications, they are generally quick, often strong, and not very
   intelligent. Classic Examples include the Baktoid Combat Automata B1 battle droid and the E522 Series Assassin Droid.
   +2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, -4 Intelligence

  &gFifth-Degree: &wCommon laborers of the galaxy &g- &wcheap, predictable, and in most cases, disposable. They are mainly employed
   for carrying heavy loads or performing repetitive tasks. Example: ASP Series labor droid and J9 worker drone.
   +2 Strength, -2 Wisdom, -2 Charisma

&wDroid characters, in additon to taking heroic feats, also have the option of purchasing &rAccessories&w. Under no circumstances,
can a Droid ever possess the Force, Force Skills or Force Classes.

up  lost causes. These huge, snakelike multipeds with gossamer wings average 
about ten meters long. Large, reptilian scales cover their bodies, though they 
have floppy, mammallike ears. Each body segment has a pair of legs, though the 
limbs attached to the foward segments have evolved into arms and hands. This 
ancient species comes from a secret, unknown world. They can be encountered on 
all types of worlds and even in deep space, where it seems they n eed to 
artificial protection. The Star Dragons have a deep-rooted sense of morality 
and honor, and most have at least some sensitivity to the Force. There are even 
tales that tell of an ancient time when Duinuoqwuin served as Jedi Knights.

Because of their enormous size Duinouqwuin cannot wear armor. However they
have excellent hit points and regeneration rate. They also fave the unique
ability to fly. They are also very strong in the force.

advanced technologically. Most Duros are interested in space travel, and
are employed in one of the many industries that deal in travel between the
stars. Those Duros  who remain near their homeworld work for one of the
many starship construction facilities that orbit the planet Duro. Many of
the Duros found off-planet are graduates of the Duro Academy of Deep Space
Exploration, and can navigate a  hyperspace jump with limited star
charting.

Drink instructs your character to drink from a fountain or a drink container
to alleviate thirst.
 
Eat instructs your character to eat an item of food or a magical pill (which
function in a similar fashion as potions); pills do not fill stomach space.

tell you if you are starving or dying of thirst, and can check your
current state with either 'score' or 'oldscore'), you will not regain
hitpoints, movement points or force back as rapidly as if you were well
fed and hydrated.
 
If you stay hungry or thirsty too long and you are not an Avatar, your
mental state will begin to suffer.  Your combat skills will be affected,
your coordination will suffer and you may begin to either hallucinate or
become depressed.  Eating, drinking and a little rest will solve this
problem after a short period of time.

~

31 ECONOMY~
Each area will initialize (on bootup of the mud) with a pool of gold based
on the area's range and the wealth of each mob in that area.
 
The shopkeepers and thieves will automatically deposit gold into the economy
if they are carrying more than a certain amount (the higher the level of the
shopkeeper, the greater they will carry before depositing).
 
To allow mobprogs to be created to manipulate area economies, making them
interactive and interdependent, there are two mpcommands:  mpdeposit, and
mpwithdraw (see related helpfiles).  There is also an 'if economy' ifcheck.
 
The aset command can also be used to adjust an area's economy by hand
(example:  aset <area filename> low_economy <amount>, this will give
the specified area a minimum economy at the level you set).
 
Mobs will not repop with more gold than what they were originally created
with, but if the area economy runs low they will begin to repop with less
until the economy is replenished (as they all share the same gold pool).
 
Use foldarea to make changes to an area's economy with aset permenent.

&gClass Type: &wNon-Force Droid Prestige Class

droids, but those that have exceptional technical skills &g(&wsuch as R-series droids and 2-1B droids&g)&w and those that are 
commonly seen in the company of Humans &g(&wsuch as protocol droids&g)&w are prime candidates to bear espionage programming. A

and machinery. Espionage droids are employed not only to gather information and data but also to further the goals of their masters,
whatever they might be.

0 EWOK ENDOR~
The Curious, furred bipeds native to Endor's forest moon are called Ewoks. 
Standing about one meter tall, the tribal Ewoks have yet to advance beyond 
spears and bows, but their understanding of forest lore and survival skills 
cannot be matched by a more advanced species. These Hunter gatherers live in 
village clusters built high within the moon's giant trees. Easily startled, the 
Ewoks are nonetheless brave, alert, and loyal, and they can be fierce warriors 
when necessary. The Ewok language is liquid and expressive, and most humans and 
other aliens can learn to speak it. Ewoks, conversely can learn Basic, though 
they often mix in many words from their own language. During the day, Ewoks 
come down out of their tree villages to hunt and forage on the forest floor. At 
night, the forest belongs to huge carnivores, and even the youngest Ewoks know 
not to venture out after dark. The Ewoks' mystical beliefs contain many 
references to the Force, though it is never named as such. They are a musical 
species, are overly curious, and are loyal to their tribes and friends.

~

31 EXITMAKING~
The 'redit exit' command is used to create, modify and remove exits in a room.
For more than one exit in the same direction see ADVANCEDEXITS.

The syntax of the 'redit exit' command is as follows:
redit exit <direction> [vnum] [exit-type] [key] [keyword(s)]
direction: one of: n, s, e, w, u, d, ne, nw, se, sw or ?
vnum     : the room number in which the exit leads to.
exit-type: a number detailing the exit -- has a door, open/closed/locked etc.
key      : a number corresponding to a key object which can unlock the door.
keywords : keywords used to refer to the door, (or exit).

If only 'redit exit <direction>' is specified, the exit will be removed.
The 'key' field is optional when specifying keywords.  All other fields are
required previous to the field desired.

Examples:
redit exit n 3001           - Creates an exit north to room 3001
redit exit n 3001 3 gate    - Changes the exit north to have a closed "gate"
redit exit n 3001 3 15 gate - Changes the gate to allow use of a key vnum 15
redit exit n                - Removes the north exit

See EXITTYPES for generating the exit-type value.
~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).
~

31 EXITTYPES~
These are the currently valid exit-types:
      0 - Plain exit
      1 - Door exists         (Required to be closed or locked)
      2 - Door is Closed
      4 - Door is Locked
      8 - Door is Secret      (Trying to go that way won't reveal door)
     32 - Door is Pickproof   (Door can't be picked by power or skill)
     64 - Need to be able to fly to go that way
    128 - Need to be able to climb to go that way
   1024 - Door is Passdoor proof

NOTE: You must ADD the values together to generate an exit-type:
        3 = a closed door
        7 = a closed and locked door
       11 = a closed secret door
       15 = a closed, locked and secret door

-- Use the 'redit exflags' command to change these flags, and to set the
   advanced exit flags, most of which are not shown above.

See EXFLAGS and EXITMAKING.
~

0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Syntax:  level
 
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  Type LEVEL to see
how many experience points you'll need for the next few levels.
 
You gain experience by:
    inflicting damage upon an opponent
    being part of a group that kills an opponent
    succeeding while learning a skill or a power through real world usage
 
You lose experience by:
    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of some powers (energy drain, etc.)
    dying
 
The experience you get from a kill depends on several things:  how many 
players are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster;
your alignment versus the monster's alignment and some random variation.
 
Your last 25 kills are recorded.  Each time you kill a creature that has
been one of your last 25 kills you will receive less and less exp for it.
The creature will also learn from its experience with you over time; if
its intelligence is higher than your own it will begin to gain an
advantage over you in combat.

&gName: &wFalleen

&gDescription: &wThe Falleen are a species of reptilian humanoids from the Mid Rim system of the same name. They are widely regarded
as one of the most aesthetically pleasing species of the galaxy, with an exotic appearance and powerful pheromone-creating
abilities. While their pheromones are to attract suitable mates, they also have a pronounced effect on other humanoid species,
leading many to describe Falleen as "irresistible". Falleen commoners encountered offworld are almost always part of an entourage
led by a Falleen noble or diplomat. They can speak Basic with no difficulty.

&gPersonality: &wFalleen are well mannered, self-assured, and driven to succeed. Even at the worst, they possess undeniable and
unshakable charisma. Sometimes their sense of superiority makes them arrogant and seductive, but Falleen can also be sensitive
and compassionate.

deep green or gray-green, but the color fluctuates toward red and orange when they release their pheromones. Male and female 
Falleen are almost identical physically, except that the spiny ridge that runs down the back of the males is more pronounced than
the one that runs down the back of the females.

indictate how hard a fight might be.  You can CONSIDER <mob> for a one on
one comparison of the mobs hitpoints and level to your own.  You may also
FEEL IDENTIFY <mob> to get more detailed information about the mob if you
have force ability.   You may start a fight by using KILL, MURDER, or many
powers and skills available to players.  The easiest way to start a fight
is to KILL <mob>. Currently, you may also MURDER <mob>, but this causes
the mob to yell out. You may also set it up to flee automatically once you
go below a certain number of hitpoints by using WIMPY.  To use your wimpy,

tall humanoids native to the planet Firrerre, they beings have unique

which turns silver when scarred. They possessed limited spacefaring
technology, and had only  recently perfected sublight travel when Hethrir
convinced them to head for nearby planets while being held in hibernation.
Those that were placed on the colony ships are the only surviving
Firrerreo, because Hethrir later turned the  planet over to the Empire,
which destroyed the ecosystem with a biological weapon. Hethrir had been
raiding the colony ships for slaves over the years, until his death at the
hands of the being Waru. The Firrerreo have strong clan  affiliations, and
a fair amount of Force sensitivity. They rarely used their given names
aloud, but the use of Firrerreo's name compelled the being to obey the
speaker.

of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

In order to RESCUE successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~

1 FLOAT~
Syntax: feel 'float' <character>
 
This power enables the target character to float.  It is useful in saving
mv (movement points), makes a character float slowly to the ground when
falling from in the air, and allows you to move over water and through the
air.

If character is already a member of your group, using 'group <character>'
will remove them from your party.  Removing the character from the group
does not stop them from following you, however.  A character can also
leave your group by using the 'follow self' command, in which case they
will both leave your group and stop following you.
 
'Group' with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.

via 'cset' (see 'help cset').
 
~

0 FORCE~
The force is an essential part of our nature  like energy or matter  but it
has yet to be quantified or analyzed. The force is not to be understood in
the same manner as the physical qualities of the universe.  The laws of
physics are observable; technology is predictable and readily-controlled.
The Force is neither controlled nor controlling  it is a part of life
itself; asking if it controls or can be controlled is like asking  if a
person can control his component cells, or the cells control him.
 
It is not known whether the force has always been, came about as life
evolved into intelligence, or if it coerced the evolution of intelligence.
To the Jedi, it does not matter. Its enough to know the force IS.

0 'FORCE ADEPT'~
&gName: &wForce Adept

&gClass Type: &bForce&w Base Class

&gMax Level: &w20

&gDescription: &wThe Force adept is strong in the Force, but follows a different path from the Jedi. To the Force adept, the Force
is more mysterious and more supernatural, and the aid it provides has a magical quality. A Force adept comes from a different
tradition, with different beliefs and codes of conduct from those of the Jedi. There are precious few Force adepts, and the number
who become adventurers is even smaller. Some call the Force by its familiar name, while others refer to it by some other term that
reflects their own traditions. If you select the Force adept class, you need to determine how your character views the Force.

&gBackground: &wForce adepts discover a power inside themselves that they don't fully understand. Much of their training is haphazard,
since few traditions exist to help them achieve mastery. Some come from primitive cultures where they were looked upon as godlike
or holy by the people they served. Others just follow a different path from the Jedi &g- &wit isn't better or worse, it's just a
different tradition. Force adepts have grown accustomed to being either revered or hated, depending on when and where their Force
powers came to prominence. Others have learned to keep their powers secret, both because they do not fully understand their powers
and because they are afraid of how others might treat them.

&gAbilities: &wThe Force adept's most important ability scores are Intelligence and Wisdom, sience these control her most important
Force skills &g(&wthose of the Alter and Sense feats&g)&w, as well as many other class skills. Charisma can also be significant
for a variety of interpersonal skills.

&gHitpoints: &wForce adepts gain 1-8 hitpoints per leve. The character's Constitution applies.

&gClass Type: &wNon-Force Base Class

&gMax Level: &w20

&gDescription: &wFringers come from outside society, replacing a formal education with skills and knowledge gained from experience.
Usually, a fringer hails from a world that lies outside the "civilized" regions of space, but fringers can come from the fringe
of galactic socity &g-&w where-ever that may be. They use their dexterity, 
wisdom, and strength to survive whatever the galaxy throws
at them. A fringer isn't necessarily unfamiliar with technology, but he certainly doesn't have access to the conveniences 
available to thsoe of higher status on worlds such as Coruscant and Corellia. The fringer is hardy, robust, independent, and an
expert at survival due to learning the lessons of "frontier" regions, be they in the Outer Rim or in the dankest levels of Coruscant.
Some fringers might be from primitive, low-tech societies, but most have a basic understanding of high-tech equipment &g- &wthey just
come from a world or a part of society where such equipment is in extremely short supply.

&gBackground: &wFringers come to their profession by seeking a better life, searching for excitement, escaping the situation on their
planet of origin, or avenging an imagined wrong done by the &bRepublic&w or some other power group. Some seek wealth and power,
others adventure. Others still are motivated by revenge. They may be lured from their home world by the promise of riches. They
may be escaping from slavery or servitude. They could be recruited to a cause they believe is worth following, or driven from their
home by invaders. They usually think of themselves not as fringers but as whatever career they aspire to, such as spacer, mechanic,
pilot, or colonist.

&gAbilities: &wDexterity, Wisdom, and Strength are the most important ability scores for the fringer class.

&gHitpoints: &wFringers gain 1-8 hitpoints per level. The character's Constitution applies.

between 1 and 20. On a natural 20, the hit always lands on target, regardless of the target's armor class. This is called a critical
hit. On a critical hit, you have a small chance of dismembering one of your opponent's limbs. The opposite is also true. If you
score a natural 1, you will miss your target. Not only will you miss your intended target, there is a chance of hitting a member
of your group &g(&wif you're in a group&g)&w. If you are fighting solo, you will drop your weapon.

0 GOTAL~
a humanoid race which possesses a limited ability to sense the Force, the
Gotal have grey fur, and two cone-like horns on top of their heads. These
horns are actually nerve-filled receptors that register the presence of
infrared, radio,  light, and electromagnetic emissions. These cones also
have the ability to sense the presence of the Force as a vague buzzing.
They come from a moon called Antar 4, and have an instinctual distrust of
droids, for the droids' energy emissions  foul up their sensitive horns.
The Gotal have come to rely on their cones for a great many things and, as
a consequence, they have a hard time interpreting the emotions of other
races. The one emotion most Gotal are sure of is love, and  falling in
love at first sight is a common occurance among prospective mates. When
two Gotals mate, they do so for life and begin raising a family as soon as
possible. The Gotal are a race of hunters, and have little or no political
 affiliations. They have one of the few societies which exists in a
peaceful anarchy. The Gotal resisted entry into the Old Republic, but had
absolutely no desire to join the Empire.

0 GRAN~
a race of three-eyed humanoids native to the planet Kinyen, the Gran have
tan skin. Their eyes are set out away from their heads on thick stalks,
and they have large ears. Their eyes are adapted for seeing into the
visible spectrum as  well as the infrared spectrum. They evolved from a
herbivorous species, and have two stomachs to digest their food. The
females have three breasts, which they use to suckle their young. In
general, Gran are peaceful and hospitable, and no  conflicts have been
noted in their 10,000 year history. Their infrared sight allows the Gran
to detect their companion's emotional state. The Gran race was hesitant to
join the galactic community of the Old Republic, fearing that they  would
become diluted by huge distances. They remained isolated from the
Republic, for the most part, and the Old Republic respected their wishes.
After the birth of the New Order, the Gran organized peaceful protests
against  Palpatine's rule. However, they were quickly subjugated by the
Empire. On their own, the Gran developed space travel, and have developed
a healthy trade route.

       experiencing a display problem with the file, use a . to begin the file.

~

1 HLIST~

This command will give you a listing of available help files. The list

track help files, it is also available to players so that they can
capture a listing of the help files available to them. 
 
Note - You may only view help files that are coded for viewing by your
       level or lower.
 
Note - The list of help files is quite extensive, and the command does
       not as yet have a way to filter/shorten the list. Screen capture
       is, at present, your only recourse.

0 HODIN HO'DIN~
&gName: &wHo'Din

&gDescription: &wHo'Din means "&Ywalking flower&w" in the native language of this gentle species. Although Ho'Din religion claims
that the species descended from plant life, the Ho'Din actually evolved from reptiles. Nevertheless, Ho'Din are taught to 
believe that those who strive to preserve nature in life will be reborn as plants after death. The Ho'Din show little interest
in galactic affairs and for the most part keep to themselves. The Ho'Din use their botanical skills to concoct natural medicines,
some of which have cured plagues on distant worlds.

&gPersonality: &wHo'Din are self-conscious and vain. Their concern with beauty is usually centered either on their personal
appearance or that of their floral and arboreal creations. They do not take insults or criticism well and use modern technological
device only when necessary.

&gPhysical Description: &wHo'Din are slender humanoids with brightly colored scales, a crown of snakelike stalks for hair, large
black eyes, and naturally webbed fingers and toes with suction cups. Their anemone hair can sense even the slightest variation
or change in temperature. The average Ho'Din stands about 2.75 meters tall.

&gHomeworld: &wMoltok, a world of rain forests and volcanoes, is located in the Outer Rim. Technology is closely monitored and
restricted on Moltok, for fear that it might somehow be used to harm the planet's delicate ecosystem.

&gSpecies Traits: &w+2 Strength, -2 Dexterity
                Large-Sized &g- &w-1 Hitroll, -1 Armor, -4 Species Penalty On &rHide&w Checks

You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly.

~

31 HOLYLIGHT INVIS~
Syntax: holylight
Syntax: invis

HOLYLIGHT is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

INVIS is a toggle which makes you completely invisible to all player characters
of lower level than you, and to all mobiles.

When an immortal is INVIS, they will have a flag on the who list which 
indicates their level of invisibility, such as (51) for INVIS 51.  A 
similar flag will also appear when you 'LOOK' in a room - this flag will 
say (Invis 51).

HOLYLIGHT will not allow you to see immortal INVIS characters who are
higher level than you.
~

10 HOMEPAGE~
syntax: homepage <url>
 
example: homepage http://www.idirect.com/test.html
 
If you have a web page somewhere, you can use the homepage
command to show people a link to that page whenever they

home page.

31 HSET~
Syntax:  hset  <command> [value] [help topic]
 save                            Saves all help pages (to help.are)
 level <level> <help topic>      Sets help topic to specified level
 keyword <keyword> <help topic>  Sets help keyword to specified keyword
 remove <level.><help topic>     Removes the specified help page
 
Note:  If you wish to set more than one keyword to a help topic, enclose all
       the keywords, space separated inside quotes.  (Like in powercasting)
Note:  If you have instances of multiple help files with the same keyname,
       using Hset Remove without a level designation will remove the one with
       the lowest level of access. ie:
 
       Help file XYZZY at level 57, and help file 'SAVE XYZZY' at level 58.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE XYZZY' will remove the level 57 XYZZY.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE 58.XYZZY' will remove the level 58 'SAVE XYZZY'.

0 'HUTT CRIME SYNDICATE'~
&gName: &wHutt Criminal Syndicate

&gOrganization Type: &wCriminal Organization

&gDescription: &wWherever there is civilization, there is crime &g-&w and when civilization spans a galaxy, so too will its criminals.
The galaxy knows no greater criminals than the Hutts. From their adoptive homeworld of Nal Hutta, the sluglike Hutts control the
vast majority of the Outer Rim's trade in liquor, spice, weapons, slaves, and gambling. The Hutts are in the business of making 
all these restricted commodities more easily available and earning a respectable profit in the process. Those who choose to work 
with the Hutts can also find their fortunes, for the Hutts reward loyalty with a special generosity. The influence of the Hutts
spans the galaxy &g- &wperhaps even into the Unknown Regions. The center of the Hutt criminal syndicate is Nal Hutta, where
centuries ago the Hutts migrated after their own world, Varl, became uninhabitable. The Hutts promptly terraformed their new
world and its moon, Nar Shaddaa, into something more suitable to their rarified tastes: a glorious cesspool and an industrialized
spaceport, respectively. From here, they seized control of most of the illegal businesses in the area and used cunning, guile,
and coercion to create a commercial stranglehold on their corner of space.

&gJoining: &wActually accepting a permanent position with the Hutts is an endeavor best left to the foolishly ambitious or the
suicidally hopeless. To the Hutts, an employment contract is effectively no different than a certificate of ownership, and though
the pay is good, the bosses are often moody, vindictive, short-tempered, and treacherous. Employees are assets to be bought, sold,
and traded &g-&w or even discarded on a whim. Only the profoundly cunning and charismatic can ever hope to truly prosper in a Hutt's
employ. Sometimes this isn't difficult; not all Hutts are paranoid geniuses, after all. The amount of bowing and scraping may be
a bit higher than comparable jobs, bit if it keeps the bosses happy, where's the harm? Ultimately, signing on with the Hutts is
all about getting paid &g- &wand in that regard, it's no different than any other job.

0 HUTT HUTTS~
&gName: &wHutt

&gDescription: &wHutts are long-lived gastropods who occupy a region known as Hutt Space. They are powerful, ruthless beings who
continually seek to expand the boundaries of their dominion and the holdings of their individual clans, or &Ykajidics&w. Their
appetite for power is as insatiable as their appetite for food. Hutts are often found at the center of business and criminal
enterprises. Legality &g(&wor lack thereof&g)&w does not affect whether a Hutt will pursue a venture. All that matters is how
much of a benefit &g-&w and a profit&g - &wone can get from it. Like worms, Hutts are hermaphroditic, with both male and female
reproductive organs. Hutts bear their young one at a time and nourish them for a time in a brood pouch. A council of elders 
oversees Hutt Space. Comprised of Hutts representing the oldest and most influential kajidics, they decide the fate of everyone
who lives in Hutt Space, and all other Hutts are answerable to them.

&gPersonality: &wMost Hutts are vicious megalomaniacs who consider their kind to be beyond morality as perceived by lesser beings.
They have a talent for manipulating other beings and enjoy accumulating and exerting power over others. A Hutt's strongest 
loyalty is always to his kajidic, without which a Hutt is nothing but a lowly commoner.

&gPhysical Description: &wA Hutt is an immense, slug-like creature with a thick body, muscular tail, and small arms protruding
from its upper body. A Hutt's bulbous head features catlike eyes, wide nostrils, and a broad lipless mouth. An adult Hutt
averages 4 meters long and weighs 1,500 kilograms.

&gHomeworld: &wHutts evolved on the temperate forest world of Varl. When a natural calamity left Varl a blasted wasteland, the
Hutts fled and adopted a new homeworld: Nal Hutta, in the Y'Troub system on the boarder of the Mid Rim and Outer Rim. The Hutts
have spent centuries polluting and ruining Nal Hutta's ecosystem, as well as that of Nar Shaddaa, a heavily industrialized moon
orbiting Nal Hutta.

&gSpecies Traits: &w +2 Strength, -4 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, +2 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom, +2 Charisma

1 IC OOC "IN CHARACTER" " OUT OF CHARACTER"~
&C

IC - In character - Means that you're not chatting with your friends about
friday nights plans, or what to wear to the mall, it means what your MUD
CHARACTER is saying. Ignorance is  no excuse for misusing channels, if you
mean to jokingly tell someone OOC you're going to kill them but do it IC
they have every right to defend themselves and attack you if they feel
threatened. You can use the ask and answer, as well as tell channels (if
you don't understand  them there's a reason someone teaches languages)
if;you want to talk OOC or just go to a hotel, it's not that difficult and
it's cheaper then using IC and clears up any confusion and lessens whining
because someone was killed because they "accidentally said the wrong
thing on the wrong channel".
&Y
OOC - Out of Character - Means you're talking about issues not
game related like a bug or have another mud-based question, this
does not mean you go "Hey Jim I need food pick me up" or "Hey 
So and So just killed me I'm gonna get you!" however there are a 
constantly growing number of help files and most of your basic 
questions should be there for answering, but yes there are times
here there are questions only an imm or a fellow player can answer.
However Excessive abuse of OOC will result in possibly being silenced.

0 IKTOTCHI~
&gName: &wIktotchi

&gDescription: &wIktotch, a remote star system in the Expansion Region, has a single planetary body capable of supporting life &g- &w
a moon orbiting a lifeless mass of rock on the system's edge. Here, the Iktotchi arose as the sole intelligent life in a desolate
system, yet from their earliest civilization they had legends of some day being part of a great galactic civilization that 
spanned the star. When &bRepublic&w scouts first discovered their civilization, they were both surprised and unnerved that the
entire population of Iktotchon had been prepared for thei arrival for several weeks. In fact, when the scout ship first entered
orbit around the moon, they thought they had found an unreported &bRepublic&w settlement &g- &wa giant version of the Republic
seal, visible from space to the naked eye, had been carved into a high plateau on the world's largest continent. &bRepublic&w
xenobiologists soon learned that the Iktotchi possessed limited natural precognition, manifested through dreams or vision. This
inborn talent particularly fascinated the &bJedi&w, and a Jedi Temple was one of the first permanent offworld settlements to be
established on Iktotchon. They discovered that Iktotchi trained as &bJedi&w were particularly adept with &rSense&w powers, and
Iktotchi precognitive ability could actually be enhanced with Force training.

&gPersonality: &wIktotchi are sensitive being who hide their deep emotions behind a facade of quiet stoicism. Iktotchi can be
somewhat impatient with species that aren't precognitive. Culturally, they are also concerned about frightening other beings &g- &w
they have no desire to be reviled by galactic society or abused by those who might use their precognitive abilities for ill &g- &w
so their natural gifts sometimes seem more like a curse.

&gPhysical Description: &wThe Iktotchi have tough, hairless skin that protects them from the fierce winds of their homeworld. Adults
average 1.8 meters tall and possess sturdy builds. Both males and females have downward-curving horns, although the horns of the
males are somewhat larger. Their hands are broad, and their thick fingers give them a limited manual dexterity.

&gHomeworld: &wIktotch, a moon orbiting the planet Iktotchon in the Expanion Region.

determined by the combination of crystals used. Attempting to imbue a crystal costs a player a force

to be added. Once a lightsaber is constructed, there is no way to remove the crystals.

31 INSTAROOM INSTAZONE~

Syntax:  instazone [nodoors]
 
This command lets your instantly create a whole set of resets for your area
based on all the mobiles and objects contained within your area.
All you have to do is place each mob in its proper room, wearing what it
should be wearing, carrying what it should be carrying, and objects in their
proper places, or in their proper containers, and doors in their proper
states, (open, closed, locked).  The instazone command will clear out your
current resets (if any), and create new ones for you.
You may optionally specify "nodoors" so that door resets will not be
created.
 
NOTE:  This command will wipe out any existing resets!  Do not use this
command after you have added your own resets with 'reset add'.
The recommended procedure is to use instazone, then use the 'reset' command
to add any special resets, and NOT use instazone again.
 
See RESET and RESETCMDS.

1 INTELLIGENCE INT~

a character fights a creature several times, the more intelligent of the
two opponents will gain an advantage over time...

means of verbal threats, force of will, and imposing body language. Successfully
intimidateing a mob grants you control over it for a brief time. This  skill cannot
be used on players.
~

1 INTRODUCE~
At FotE we have an introduction system that is more RP focused than most.

&wSyntax:  introduce <player/all> <your preferred name>&W

If a character comes across another character, they will only know them
by their race, sex, build, and approximate height. However, when someone
introduces themself, such as &w'introduce <player> Admiral Thrawn'&W, or
&w'introduce all Admiral Thrawn'&W, that person or everyone on the room you
are in will see you, hear you, and look at you as 'Admiral Thrawn'.

You don't have to limit yourself to a name, though. You can introduce
yourself to an engineer as 'A customer', or introduce yourself to someone
who is gullible enough as 'An Imperial Tax Official'.

Disguises work a bit different here than from stock SWR, as well. No matter
whom you've introduced yourself to, your disguise will be what they see, hear,
and look at. If you want to look how you've introduced yourself, you can
type &wdisguise clear&W to remove it.

&RIt would be good to note that impersonation of an Immortal or introducing as
something that may be construed as offensive, lewd, or inappropriate to the
MUD's setting will not be tolerated. An infraction of this will result in any
punishment deemed necessary by an Immortal. Period.

0 ITHORIAN~
strange looking natives of Ithor, these creatures' heads appear to have
been stretched and bent like a ladle. The eyes are set at opposite sides
of the hammer-shaped top portion of the head, and their mouths are hidden
below on the   sloping part of the head. They have wide, flat feet
designed to keep their balance. They also have two throats, and this
biological phenomenon makes them hard to understand. This caused them a
great deal of pain when the Empire  discovered their planet, for the
Imperial xenophobia was heightened by their inability to communicate.

0 JAWA JAWAS~
&gName: &wJawa

&gDescription: &wJawas are intelligent scavengers of short stature. Found in seemingly every dark nook and cranny of Tatooine, Jawas
survive by scrounging for scrap, which forms the basis of their economy, and hiding from the planet's terrible predators. Although
not advanced technologically, Jawas have a gift for discovering unusual ways to make things work &g-&w atleast for a little while.
Though most people despise Jawas for their underhanded practices &g(&wand unpleasant odor&g)&w, they also realize that Jawas
occasionally lay their hands on priceless treasures. Jawas prowl the deserts and rocky basins of their homeworld in enormous
tracked vehicles called sandcrawlers. These vehicles also contain workshops and storage chambers cluttered with teasure or junk,
depending on how one views scrap.

&gPersonality: &wJawas are opportunistic and cowardly. They have a well-deserved reputation as thieves and swindlers, although
they would hardly consider these words insults. Jawas are proud of their ability to acquire what others obviously no longer need
and sell things that require frequent maintenance and costly replacement parts.

&gPhysical Description: &wJawas stand 1 meter tall, on average. They wear dark-hooded robes that cover all but their glowing eyes.
Xenobiologists speculate that Jawas evolved from cave-dwelling rodents, and few other species that have dealt with Jawas would
disagree.

&gHomeworld: &wTatooine, located in the Outer Rim.

&gSpecies Traits: &w-4 Strength, +2 Dexterity, -2 Charisma

0 'JEDI ACE'~
&gName: &wJedi Ace

&gClass Type: &bForce &wPrestige Class

&gMax Level: &w5

&gDescription: &wA Jedi ace feels most at home in the cockpit of a starfighter and uses her mastery of the Force in the exhilarating
art of starfighter combat. Using her connection to the Force, the Jedi ace can weave effortlessly through asteroid fields, dodge
storms of enemy laser fire, execute death-defying combat maneuvers, and overcome entire squadrons of enemy craft as easily as she
breathes. A Jedi ace flies her ship not for the thrill of battle, but for the connection to the Force it brings. As the Jedi ace 
slowly surrenders to the Force, flying almost takes care of itself. Even in a great battle, a Jedi ace trusts her instincts to
lead her to victory. When the battle is over, the Jedi ace feels closer to the Force than ever before. Jedi aces usually belong
to the Jedi Order. They have turned their command of the Force to battles fought in space rather than on the ground.

&gRequirements: &wHitroll +4, Pilot 6, See Force 4, Force-Sensitive, Must Be A Jedi

&gHitpoints: &wJedi aces gain 1-8 hitpoints per level. The character's Constitution applies.

&wAlso see &rhelp jediaceprof&w for more information.
~

0 'JEDI CONSULAR'~
&gName: &wJedi Consular

&gClass Type: &bForce &wBase Class

&gMax Level: &w20

&gDescription: &wThe Jedi consular uses the Force for knowledge and negotiation, seeking the most peaceful solutions to every problem.
As Force-users trained in the Jedi tradition, characters of this class concentrate more on diplomacy, scholarly pursuits, and
the spiritual side of the Force than on more physical activities. Healers and researchers seek to better understand the nature of
the Force and their connection to it. Mentors and teachers hope to instruct others and pass on what they have learned. Negotiators
and mediators are skilled at bargaining and striking compromises. Consulars train themselves to be versatile, able to handle many
situations without reaching for a weapon.

&gBackground: &wA Jedi consular typically starts out as a Padawan learner attached to a higher-ranking Jedi Master. The Jedi consular
has a genuine love of scholarly pursuits and diplomatic endeavors. Some consulars want to teach, others want to learn. A Jedi
consular has a deep connection to his mentor and the Jedi Order but often operates with only tangential contact with either master
or order.

&gAbilities: &wA Jedi consular should be gifted in all abilities, but Wisdom, Charisma, and Intelligence are the most important. Those
who expect to fall back on their combat prowess should also have high Strength and Constitution score.

&gHitpoints: &wJedi consulars gain 1-8 hitpoints per level. The character's Constitution applies.

&wAlso see &rhelp consularprof&w for more information.
~

0 'JEDI GUARDIAN'~
&gName: &wJedi Guardian

&gClass Type: &bForce &wBased Class

&gMax Level: &w20

&gDescription: &wForce-users trained in the Jedi tradition, Jedi guardians combine physical training with mastery of the Force. Jedi
guardians concentrate on battle prowess, defense, lightsaber training, and physical activities. If Jedi consulars are the ambassadors
of the Jedi Order, guardians are the defenders, protecting the Republic from all dangers. Few are strong enough in the Force and
have the devotion to walk the Jedi's path, but those few are awarded with a powerful ally. They walk in a larger world than those
who neither feel nor heed the Force.

&gBackground: &wA Jedi guardian typically starts out as a Padawan learner attached to a Jedi Master. The Jedi guardian has a genuine
desire to use the Force to help the people of the galaxy. A guardian has a deep connection to her mentor and the Jedi Order but
often operates with only tangential contact with either master or order.

&gAbilities: &wA Jedi guardian should be gifted in all abilities but Constitution and Strength are most important. Dexterity is also
useful. Wisdom and Intelligence are the backbone of more important Force skills.

&gHitpoints: &wJedi guardians gain 1-10 hitpoints per level. The character's Constitution applies.

&wAlso see &rhelp guardianprof&w for more information.
~

0 'JEDI INVESTIGATOR'~
&gName: &wJedi Investigator

&gClass Type: &bForce &wPrestige Class

&gMax Level: &w5

&gDescription: &wA Jedi investigator is a specially appointed representative of the Jedi Council charged with uncovering hidden
threats to the galaxy. Threats worthy of a Jedi investigator's attention include darksiders, shady criminal syndicates preying on
the innocent, corrupt officials conspiring against the &bRepublic&w or the Jedi Council. The Jedi investigator's duty is to root
out these threats, discover their agendas, and disclose his findings to the Jedi Council so that the appropriate actions can be
taken. In a way, the Jedi investigator brings darkness into the light. A Jedi investigator is a skilled insurgent, not above using
guile, deception, and force to insinuate himself into a group or organization for the purpose of gathering information. Upon
discovering a threat to the &bRepublic&w or the galaxy at large, a Jedi investigator might be called upon to neutralize the threat
before widespread conflict erupts. This is much easier to accomplish from within, particularly when the Jedi investigator has no
one to help him. When confronted by a criminal syndicate, a Jedi investigator might try to join the organization to learn more 
about its operations. When confronted by a cabal of dark side devotees, the Jedi investigator might try to lure them out of their
lair and into the reach of a team of Jedi guardians. The Jedi Council keeps detailed records of known criminals &g(&wpirates, smugglers,
and assassins mostly&g)&w and often uses Jedi investigators to spy on these individuals. A Jedi investigator might be called upon
to capture dangerous criminals before they can strike again, although more often than not the Jedi Council hires or appoints others
to assist the investigator in completing such missions. Often, a Jedi investigator operates in secret. Usually, only the Jedi
Council &g(&wor perhaps a few members or even only one member&g)&w knows about the investigator's mission. Sometimes an investigator
goes undercover to reveal a threat or even appears to leave the Jedi Order to perform a mission.

&gRequirements: &wEnhance Senses 4, Gather Information 6, Search 3, See Force 4, Alter, Control, Force-Sensitive, Sense, Must Be Jedi

&gHitpoints: &wJedi investigators gain 1-8 hitpoints per level. The character's Constitution applies.

&wAlso see &rhelp investigatorprof&w for most information.
~

1 'JEDI MASTER'~
&gName: &wJedi Master

&gClass Type: &bForce &wPrestige Class

&gMax Level: &w10

&gDescription: &wJedi Masters represent the pinnacle of the Jedi Order. They are Jedi who are both strong enough in the Force and
patient enough in life to pass on their skills by teaching a new generation of Jedi. The journey from Padawan learner to Jedi Master
usually takes decades, and many who start upon the path never reach its final destination. Becoming a Jedi Master requires patience,
inner strength, wisdom, and a deep connection to and understanding of the Force. Further, a Jedi usually doesn't become a Jedi
Master until he trains a student to completion. Jedi Masters are allowed only one Padawan at a time, and the training of a single
Padawan can take years. The most respected Jedi Masters are invited by their peers &g(&wand, in some cases, their former masters&g)&w to
join them on the Jedi Council. Those who join the council use their wisdom and influence to instruct others in the ways of the 
Force and preserve peace in the galaxy. The Jedi Council is also tasked with identifying Force-sensitive children across the
galaxy and offering them instruction in the Jedi Order. These lessons are fiarly rudimentary &g-&w usually intended to teach a
student "the basics" until he or she is old enough to receive formal training as a Padawan.

&gRequirements: &wCharacter Level 7, See Force 6, Heal Self 6, Heal Other 6, Enhance Ability 6, Must Of Trained A Padawan

&gHitpoints: &wJedi Masters gain 1-8 hitpoints per level. The character's Constitution applies.

0 KELDOR~
&gName: &wKel Dor

&gDescription: &wThe Kel Dor evolved on Dorin, a world with an atmosphere consisting mostly of helium and a gas that is unique to
that world. Common atmospheres, such as those consisting mostly of oxygen, nitrogen, or carbon dioxide, are often deadly to Kel
Dor; at their mildest, they cause severe irritation fo the Kel Dor's eyes and air passages. Conversely, Dorin's atmosphere is
toxic to most beings and plant life that isn't native to the planet. When outside their dwellings on an alien world, Kel Dor
must wear breath masks and protective eyewear. They can neither breathe nor see without these devices. Most Kel Dor breath masks
include vocoders that amplify the wearer's speech; while their vocal cords function normally in their native atmosphere, Kel Dor
must shout to produce sound in more typical environments. Their eyesight, however, is enhanced when they are away from Dorin.

&gPersonality: &wThe Kel Dor are kind-hearted and even-tempered, and the average Kel Dor never ignores or refuses another being
in need. At the same time, Kel Dor believe in quick, simple justice and aren't averse to taking the law into their own hands.

&gPhysical Description: &wThe average Kel Dor stands between 1.4 and 2 meters tall, with males being taller and somewhat more
sturdy of build than the females. Their skin ranges in color from peach to deep red. Most have black eyes, though a few are born
with silver irises that some believe mark them as strong in the Force.

&gHomeworld: &wDorin, an Outer Rim world with an atmosphere toxic to non-natives.

&gSpecies Traits: &w+2 Dexterity, -2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom

0 KLATOOINIAN~
&gName: &wKlatooinian

&gDescription: &wKlatooinians are tall humanoids who hail from a harsh desert world in an isolated corner of Hutt Space. Traditionally,
Klatooinians value stability and respect the wishes of those generations that went before them. This attitude has resulted in
the Klatooinians serving the Hutts as willing slaves since before the foundation of the &bRepublic&w, due to an agreement made 
by their ancient forebearors. While the Klatooinians are aware of advanced technology and most are trained in the use of blaster
weapons so they can effectively serve their Hutt masters as guards or combat troops, many of them prefer the simpler, low-tech
lifestyle that is prevalent on their homeworld. It is far more common for a Klatooinian to wield a sword and slugthrower than
with a vibroblade and blaster.

&gPersonality: &wKlatooinians are best known for their fierce determination and loyalty. Although not terribly bright, they make
stalwart companions and are not easily offended or discouraged.

&gPhysical Description: &wKlatooinians have coarse skin that ranges from olive green to dark brown. They have flat, vaguely canine
muzzles and ark eyes set beneath pronounced brows. As adults, they stand between 1.6 and 2 meters tall with no difference in
height between males and females, although males are usually slightly heavier in build.

&gHomeworld: &wKlatooine, a desert world located in the Outer Rim.

&gSpecies Traits: &w+2 Constitution, -2 Intelligence

0 KUBAZ~
an alien race hailing from the planet Kubindi, the Kubaz have dark green
skin, a prehensile trunk, and large eyes. Their eyes are sensitive to the
red spectrum of light, and often wear large goggles when they are away
from their homeworld.  They tend to be clan-oriented, with each clan
protecting its property from other rival clans. The intense solar flares
from their planet's sun nearly destroyed the majority of food sources on
the planet, and the Kubaz were forced to hunt  insects as a staple diet.
This led to the rival clans raiding each others' insect farms. They
eventually discovered space travel, and eventually populated three of the
11 worlds orbiting the sun Ku'Bakai. This ability to move  off-planet then
introduced the Kubaz to their neighbors, the Verpine. Since the Verpine
are an insectile race by nature, the space-faring Kubaz found that the
Verpine were tasty, and began to hunt them as an additional food source.

31 LAYERS~
.
&gLayers are currently available on the following wear locations:
 
&GAbout, Arms, Body, Feet, Hands, Legs, Waist.
 
&gLayers are set with a numeric value, or combination of values.  The lower
the value, the lower the layer, or thinner the item of clothing/armor is.
 
Valid numeric values are:
 
&G0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.
 
&gOr any combination of the above. A value of zero means no other items came
be layered with this item. Items of clothing can be layered over one another
as long as their layer values do not overlap. ie, if leather armor were set
to a value of 56 (8, 16, and 32), it could not layer with, say, a set of
heavy chain that is set to a value of 96 (32 and 64), as they overlap on the
layer value of 32.

LOG ALL logs all character and mob commands and actions to the server's log
file, but does not send the output to the log channel.  It is a server-wide
toggle; it does not persist across reboots.
 
SNOOP shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.  The
character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one character
at a time.  The input from the player will be displayed with a header of the
players  name and a percentage sign (i.e. Mudder%)

of their employers when others fail. Elite bodyguards such as loyal protectors are trained from an early age to put themselves
between the person they protect and any danger, often at the cost of their own lives. These defenders are completely devoted to
safeguarding their clients, no matter what it takes. Loyal protectors do more than simply ward off physical threats. They must be
able to identify and deal with threats such as poisons in food, subtle traps, and a variety of other dangers. In addition, loyal
protectors are well trained in the art of disguise. Rather than appear as conspicuous bodyguards, they often assume alternate
identities, appearing as harmless suitors, innocuous servants, or even as the individuals they are trying to protect.

&gRequirements: &wHitroll +4, Disguise 6

&gHitpoints: &wLoyal protectors gain 1-8 hitpoints per level. The character's Constitution applies.

0 MIRALUKA~
&gName: &wMiraluka

&gDescription: &wTo all outward appearances, Miraluka appear Human. Their speech could be of any region from Coruscant to the Outer
Rim. Only one aspect distinguishes them from Humans: All Miraluka are born without eyes. Although they are not entirely 
concerned with appearing Human, they prefer not to draw attention to themselves when traveling. Millennia of evolution robbed
the Miraluka of sight but granted them the ability to "see" through the Force. Rarely is an entire species sensitive to the
ebb and flow of the Force, but Miraluka are clearly the exception. The Miraluka species epitomizes the pure power of the Force.
Not surprisingly, many Miraluka have been drawn to the teachings and traditions of the &bJedi Order&w.

&gPersonality: &wMiraluka have no interest in personal gain or glory. They are thoughtful, pensive, and deliberate. Once they
commit to a plan or course of action, they are rarely moved to change their mind.

&gPhysical Description: &wMiraluka average 1.8 meters tall. In almost every resepct, they look like Humans except they have nearly
featureless eye sockets. They tend to cover their eyeless visages with decorative cloth.

&gHomeworld: &wAlpheridies, a planet in the Abron system, which lies on the spinward edge of the Expansion Region.

0 MUUN~
&gName: &wMuun

&gDescription: &wMuunilinst, The Muun homeworld, has been the financial center of the galaxy for millennia. When the &bRepublic&w
realized a need for a standard currency, the Muuns were a natural choice to spearhead its distribution and handling. Muunilinst
is well defended and easily reached by &bRepublic&w warships. The Muuns, for the most part, take their responsibility in stride.

&gPersonality: &wMuuns are generally greedy both in business and personal life. They rarely overextend themselves, preferring 
calculated risks over rash actions. They are extraordinarily adept at mathematics, able to calculate statistics, odds, and 
intricate formulas quickly and with little effort.

&gPhysical Description: &wThe average Muun stands about 1.9 meters tall and has an elongated, almost featureless head and rail-thin body.

&gHomeworld: &wMuunilinst is a temperate Outer Rim planet. A series of orbital defense platforms protect the planet from attack.
Muunilinst guards an undisclosed cache of precious metals &g(&wcontained within secretly located vaults&g)&w used to back the Republic Credit.

&gSpecies Traits: &w-2 Strength, +4 Intelligence
                Medium-Sized
                +4 Species Bonus On &rDiplomacy&w Checks

0 'MYSTIC AGENT'~
&gName: &wMystic Agent

&gClass Type: &bForce &wPrestige Class

&gMax Level: &w10

&gDescription: &wThe mystic agent is strong in the Force and masters the arts of stealth and subterfuge. She's the one a crime lord
turns to when he wants to steal an artifact from the vaults of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. She's the one hired to retrieve a 
&bRepublic's&w senator's kidnapped daughter from a pirate fortress. Selling her expertise as a stealthy spy, swift courier, and
silent assassin, the mystic agent is the consummate master of espionage. She handles missions involving infiltration, extraction,
seduction, obfuscation, and assassination. A mystic agent typically works alone, although she relies on a web of contacts to get
her into and out of dangerous locations. She serves a variety of clients, from galactic corporations and planetary governors to
wealthy art dealers and crime syndicates, all the while keeping her true alliances veiled. Some mystic agents are interested only
in credits, while others find a cause worthy of their loyalty. Even then, some organizations and individuals hesitate to call on
the services of a mystic agent for fear of being doubled-crossed.

&gRequirements: &wHitroll +3, Battlemind 4, Hide 7, Force-Sensitive, Alter, Control

&gHitpoints: &wA mystic agent gains 1-6 hitpoints per level. The character's Constitution applies.

Well done!

~

-1 M_BALZHUR_~
Suddenly out of nowhere, a hideous beast appears, bringing with it the
horrible smell of brimstone, death and decay!

The demon gives you the most evil and spine tingling sneer that makes you
fall to your knees, and release your bladder... 

The next second, the immense mass of slimey muscle and claws is all over you
...shredding you to a bloody mess!

Mercifully, everything goes black as it moves its widening maw towards your
head...
~

-1 M_GODLVL10_~
You are all powerful!
~

-1 M_GODLVL1_~
...Everything begins to fade to black.

You feel yourself leaving your body... rising up into the air, you feel
indeed much more free than you have ever felt before...

You float high into the heavens... a vortex of ever-changing curved beams
of colored light swirling around you faster and faster...

Your soul is bursting with emotions you can barely conceive...
You feel a burning inside... both cold and hot... a tingle of electricity
grows into a powerful buzzing surge jolting through every inch of your body.

A strange chorus of voices begins to sing indecipherable and long forgotten
words... the singing grows louder and louder... a million voices as one.

You feel yourself losing touch with reality... and all goes quiet.
~

-1 M_GODLVL2_~
...You begin to feel light-headed.

Your hands begin to tingle softly...
The feeling quickly grows into a strange radiating pulse of energy! 

The tingle rises up your arms and into your head, filing your mind with
visions of worlds of wonder, far off places, great towers, vast mountains,
oceans, seas, lush valleys, dark caverns and twisted passages...
 
You sense a feeling of wonderous potential and power in your hands...
Enough power to build and create these visions for yourself!

You feel much more powerful, eager and inspired!
~

-1 M_GODLVL3_~
...You feel slightly faint as your head begins to spin.

Your hands begin to tingle once more...
A vortex of energy starts to swirl throughout your hands, going faster
and faster... becoming almost painful! 

Beams of light break through your skin, one at a time, then more and
more until the light is almost to bright to bear...

As your squint your eyes, you perceive a vision of great beasts of wonder,
dangerous and unnatural fiends, pixies, faeries, tribes and clans, peoples
of all kinds, ancient forgotten artifacts, weapons of vast untapped powers,
crystal balls, magick rings, staves, wands, rods, arcane tomes of untold
secrets... your mind is bursting with inspiration...
 
You sense a new, reborn feeling of unlimited potential and power...
In your hands the power to build and create these visions for yourself!

The bright light from your hands fades away... but strange faint glow
remains always.

Welcome to SWReality.
 
There is a help file to help you get started. Type "help newbie" to view it.
You also need to read the "help rules" file for obvious reasons.

If you notice that people are speaking gibberish thats probably because you
don't speak their language. ig. most humans don't understand wookie.
You'll have to learn other ways to communicate until you are able to learn
other languages ... see "help speak" for more info

Have fun .... :)

pains.

0 NOBLE~
&gName: &wNoble

&gClass Type: &wNon-Force Base Class

&gMax Level: &w20

&gDescription: &wMembers of the noble class use their intelligence and natural charisma to make their way in the galaxy. From true
royalty to elected officials, military commanders to crime lords, traders, merchants, ambassadors, holovid stars, and influential
corporate magnates, character types who appear in the noble class are varied and numerous. Some bring honor to the name. Others
are sly, treacherous, and dishonorable to the core. With a winning smile, a golden tongue, a powerful message, or a knack for making
compromises, the noble commands respect, makes friends, and inevitably influences people.

&gBackground: &wNobles come to their profession in a variety of ways. Altruistic nobles believe it is their duty and responsibility
to serve and lead. More selfish nobles seek the fame, wealth, and power often associated with the positions they aspire to. Power-
hungry nobles take advantage of the system and wind up helping others only to help themselves. The halls of power are calling. How
the noble answers can make all the difference.

&gAbilities: &wCharisma is undoubtedly a noble's most important ability score, as the noble's skill at interacting with others and 
projecting a sense of confidence are crucial for his or her success. Wisdom and Intelligence form the basis of other important
skills, so these ability scores are also significant.

&gHitpoints: &wNobles gain 1-6 hitpoints per level. The character's Constitution applies.

&wAlso see &rhelp nobleprof&w for more information.
~

0 'NOBLE LORD'~
&gName: &wNoble Lord

&gClass Type: &wNon-Force Clan-Specific Prestige Class

&gMax Level: &w5

&gDescription: &wTapani Sector nobles are often referred to as "Lords of the Expanse," because the large central region of planets
in the sector is referred to as the Expanse. The unique dynamics of the Tapani Sector, where the 345 different noble houses directly
rule the planets and systems, allow these noble lords to wield power rivaling senators. The major houses, such as Mecetti, Calipsa,
Pelagia, and Cadriaan, each rule several systems and billions of sentient beings. The Lords of the Expanse control the lives of 
their subjects like gleeful puppetmasters, granting prosperity through their benevolence or suffering through their malice, as 
the whim strikes them.

&gRequirements: &wDiplomacy 8, Gather Information 6, Influence, Reputation 5, Republic Membership

&gHitpoints: &wA Noble Lord gains 1-6 hitpoints per level. A character's Constitution applies.

&wAlso see &rhelp noblelordprof&w for more information.

&g(&wamong them Kihm'bar, Bakh'tor, Eikh'mir, and Hakh'khar&g)&w with a long history of bloody rivalry. The Noghri rarely travel
the world alone.

&gPersonality: &wNoghri are fierce, dedicated warriors who place the honor of their clans and the safety of their charges above all.
For a relatively primitive species, they are shrewd, quick to adapt, and mindful of customs and rituals. They do not grasp the
concept of humor well and are not particularly sociable.

30 NOKILL KILL NO~
A 'nokill' flag has been added for NAMED mobs. It doesn't make sense
for some mobs to die and then suddenly be back alive again ( the ones
with names as opposed to ones like anonymous stormtroopers etc ).

dies... It will still give experience but won't leave a corpse lying

~

31 OSET~
Syntax:  oset <object>    <field> <value>
         oset object on
 
If the copy of the object you are currently modifying has the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will also modify the index of that object, which all other
instances of the object are based on.  In the future, every copy of that obj
will reflect your modifications.
 
Also be aware that modifications to the object affect list (everything that
is listed after 'object values') will affect _every_ copy of that object in
the game, including old copies (even if they are not online).  Thus if you
change a prototype-flagged copy of a sword to +4 damroll, every copy of that
vnum ever made will reflect that change.  If you add a 'magic' flag to that
sword, however, only copies made after the change will be affected.
 
If the copy of the object you are modifying does NOT have the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will affect only that copy.
 
OSET ON will lock you onto a particular object.  Once locked on, all commands
commands will imply 'oset <object>'.  Hitting enter while in OSET ON gives
you an ostat of the object you are working on.  To get out of OSET ON, simply
type the word DONE. Example:
 
        oset staff on
        long A long gnarled staff of burnished oak lies here.
        type staff
        done

Outlaw slicers, computer specialists with criminal motivations &g(&wor atleast an anarchistic bent&g)&w, have made their mark
throughout the galaxy on all levels of business, government, crime, and the military. When a necessary computer job is illegal,
an outlaw slicer can do it &g-&ws and most likely, has done it before. Some outlaw slicers do what they do because they love the
challenge. Some embrace the "no more secrets" philosophy and "information liberator" lifestyle. Others simply appreciate the huge
piles of credits that clients pay them for illegally tampering with the clients' business competitors, romantic rivals, or political
enemies. Outlaw slicers commonly lack any concern for the privacy of others. Information stored anywhere on the HoloNet or other
information storage and retrieval systems is fair game, even if it's guarded by multiple levels of password protection and mundate
security. The inform is out there to be discovered; getting at it provides the challenge.

~

31 RASSIGN MASSIGN OASSIGN~
Syntax:  rassign <character> <begin vnum range> <end vnum range>
 
These commands allow you to assign a range of vnums to an immortal for
so that they may build inside that range.  Use the 'checkvnums' command
before assigning a range to ensure that there will be no vnum conflicts.
You can also use the 'vnums' command for a complete list of currently
allocated ranges, and the 'newzones' command for a complete list of
prototype vnum ranges.
 
Warning:  *Never* assign any vnums to a character who has another vnum
range assigned to them via 'aassign'.  Simply be sure to have the
character type 'aassign none' before assigning vnums to them.
 
Example:  massign Joseph 9000 9099
 
This will assign the vnum range from 9000 to 9099 for rooms to Joseph.
It is best to keep an areas object, room and mob range the same.
 
Be sure to always use 'checkvnums' to ensure the vnums you are going to
assign are clear.
 
See CHECKVNUMS, ZONES, NEWZONES, VNUMS
~

31 RAT~
Syntax: rat vnum1 vnum2 command [parameters]
 
Rat, or 'range at' is the at command with the added parameters of two
room vnums.  Assuming the vnums are valid, your 'at' command will be
executed in every room in the range you give.
 
Example: rat 100 110 redit flags 0
This will clear the room flags in all rooms from 100 to 110 inclusive.
~

31 RDELETE MDELETE ODELETE~
Syntax:  rdelete <vnum>

These commands will allow you to delete a vnum's entry online.
 
Be careful. Rdelete has been replaced with the more effective
cleanroom.
~

31 REBOOT SHUTDOWN WIZLOCK~
Syntax: reboot <nosave>
Syntax: shutdown <nosave>
Syntax: wizlock

REBOOT shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of sixty seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

SHUTDOWN shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.

WIZLOCK is a toggle command.  When the server is WIZLOCKed, players
below level 101 may not log in.  Players who lose their links, however,
may reconnect.

If nosave is specified for reboot or shutdown, it will not automatically 
save all of the players.

Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, force points, and movement points faster.

Restore all can be done once per day (real time) by any Saint and above,
and will 'restore' every link-live player in the game.  Restore alls such
as this are limited to once every 6 hours, so if one Savior does one,
another cannot do one until 6 hours has passed, regardless of whether or
not they have not done one that day.
 
A Greater God or higher can do a restore all whenever they wish, and are
not constrained by the above limitations.
 
Use 'restoretime' to see when the last restore all was done.
 
See RESTORETIME

Used to restrict a command to a higher or lower level.  You cannot
rstrict a command you yourself cannot access.  Changes to a command's
level are not permanent unless they are saved using 'cedit save'.  A
command's level may also be changed using 'cedit'.

0 RODIAN RODIANS RODIA~
&gName: &wRodian

&gDescription: &wRodians hail from the Tyrius star system in the Mid Rim, and their culture places great emphasis on hunting and
tracking. The Rodian homeworld is humid and choked with heavy rain forests teeming with dangerous lifeforms. The Rodians evolved 
into brutal hunters and killers to survive. As their technology became more advanced, they started exterminating other lifeforms
on their world at an increasing pace. If a &bRepublic&w scout vessel hadn't reached Rodia when it did, the world's ecosystem might
well have been damaged beyond repair, and the Rodians would have died out. Instead, they joined the &bGalacitc Republic&w, fascinated
by the powerful ships that let them travel to the stars and the mighty energy weapons used by the aliens they found there. Rodian
culture is built almost entirely around the concept of "the hunt." Their art glorifies violence and the act of stalking prey. The
more intelligent and dangerous the hunter's prey, the more honorable the hunt. Rodians have numerous annual festivals that exist
solely to honor such activities.

&gPersonality: &wRodians tend to be violent, tenacious, and dedicated.

&gPhysical Description: &wRodians have multifaceted eyes that range in color from light blue to pitch black, a tapered snout, and
skin that is universally deep green. A typical Rodian has a prominent ridge of spines running along the back of his skill. His 
fingers are long and flexible, and end in suction cups. The average Rodian stands 1.5 to 1.7 meters tall.

&gHomeworld: &wRodia, an industrial Mid Rim planet choked with heavy rian forests.

&gSpecies Traits: &w+2 Dexterity, -2 Wisdom, -2 Charisma
                Medium-Sized
                +2 Species Bonus On &rListen&w Checks

0 RYN~
&gName: &wRyn

&gDescription: &wThe Ryn are a species of interstellar vagabonds who wander the galaxy as spacehands, merchants, construction 
workers, pilots, and scouts. Known for their exhilarating music and transience, Ryn possess a certain gypsylike quality. The
Ryn have been spacefarers for so long that they have forgotten where they originated. Not even the great libraries of Obroa-skai 
or Woostri can confirm their distant origin. Theories about why the Ryn spread across the galaxy are abundant, and the Ryn themselves
have two contradictory legends regarding their past. One says that the Ryn were once fierce warriors who were set against a 
long-forgotten Inner Rim threat. Another professes that the Ryn people volunteered ten thousand of their musicians and entertainers
to a nearby world whose culture lacked poets and artists. Universally reviled and distrusted, Ryn have a reputation as thieves and
confidence tricksters, and their personal philosophy about doing whatever it takes to surive only strengthens that reputation.

&gPersonality: &wRyn are flamboyant, gregarious, self-sufficient, and driven. They work hard, often seeking employment as entertainers,
tradesfolk, mechanics, and spacehands. They love secrets and have come to expect little from other species; hence, they are
instinctively wary of any non-Ryn who offers them aid.

&gPhysical Description: &wRyn have sharp features, slender tails, and skin tones ranging from light purple to deep blue-black.
Their bodies are covered with smokey-hued fuzz ranging in color from light brown to snow white. Ryn tend to have brown or blue
eyes, although a few have green or amber eyes. Their chitinous beaks are perforated and extend down past their thin-lipped mouths.
Male Ryn cultivate large, snow-white mustaches to match their unkempt, shock-white hair. Ryn adults stand 1.4 to 1.8 meters tall.

&gHomeworld: &wUnknown, although research leads some to speculate that the Ryn homeworld lies somewhere in the Core Worlds region.

&gSpecies Traits: &wMedium-Sized

Syntax:  Save
 
SAVE saves your character and its inventory; you must be at least second
level to save.  The system automatically saves one character approximately
minute, but with the high number of players usually online it may take

rely on auto-save to keep your character updated -- save frequently.

a level in battle, getting new items, making purchases or repairs, etc.
 
Some objects (such as keys) may not be saved.

0 SCOUNDREL~
&gName: &wScoundrel

&gClass Type: &wNon-Force Base Class

&gMax Level: &w20

&gDescription: &wScoundrels are rogues &g- &wgood, bad, and neutral &g- &wwho either live outside the law or fight against it in order
to get the upper hand. They can come from any world or region of the galaxy. Most use their intelligence and dexterity to accomplish
tasks, and many rely on charisma as a fallback when all else fails. The scoundrel gets by with bravado, cunning, duplicity, and 
trickery. They live by their wits, lying, cheating, stealing, and even fighting when the need arises.

&gBackground: &wScoundrels don't often start out seeking to defy authority and break the law. Some are thrust into the profession as
a means of rebellion. Others wind up on the wrong side of the law due to back luck, porr decisions, or circumstances beyond their
control. The skills they pick up along the way make them great members of any mission team.

&gAbilities: &wDexterity and Intelligence are a scoundrel's most important ability scores, because he must ahve quick reflexes and
a sharp wit to survive. Charisma is important for talking one's way out of trouble, and Wisdom is useful for spotting trouble before
it finds the scoundrel.

&gHitpoints: &wScoundrels gain 1-6 vitality points per level. The character's Constitution applies.

~

0 SCOUT~
&gName: &wScout

&gClass Type: &wNon-Force Base Class

&gMax Level: &w20

&gDescription: &wScouts are natural explorers and adventurers, full of curiousity and trained to handle the out-of-the-way locations
where they often operate. Scouts tend to be independent, signing on when the credits are good and their skills are best utilized
and tested. Scouts understand the lay of the land and the orbit of the stars. They know how to recognize danger and locate the basic
necessities for survival. Unlike the fringer, who is born to the frontier and often wants to escape from it, the scout consciously
embraces the wild regions and understands the skills he or she possesses instead of coming to them by innate ability and 
happenstance. The scout seeks knowledge, tries to solve mysteries, and wants to be the first to see something new and different.
The scout learns to find a path through the wild regions, often becoming a decent pilot along the way, and usually learns how to
protect himself from whatever hides over the next hill or beyond the most distant nebula.

&gBackground: &wScouts come to their profession in seach of something, usually knowledge or secrets or the answers to the mysteries
of the ages. Scholars, while possibly associated with an institute of learning or a particular government, often forsake the halls
of academe for the pure research of working in the field. Pathfinders and explorers may work for a government or a military
institution, or they may take on freelance contracts from anyone willing to pay for their services. Many scouts develop into bounty
hunters, especially those who combine military skills with their tracking and searching abilities.

&gAbilities: &wMost of the scout's key skills rely on Dexterity, Intelligence, and Wisdom. Strength is also useful for the scout who
uses athletic skills.

&gHitpoints: &wScouts gain 1-8 hitpoints per level. The character's Constitution applies.

&wAlso see &rhelp scoutprof&w for more information.

31 SETBOOT~
Syntax: setboot time <hour> <minute>
 	setboot manual <0|1>

The setboot command is useful for planning a reboot, (to save you from 
the trouble of all those echos :) ) and for the daily boot.  The manual
bit is used by the mud to determine whether the boot time was set by 
hand.  When the mud starts up, the boot time is set to 0600hrs (6am)
and the manual bit to 0.  If 'setboot time' is used, the mud sets the
manual bit to 1.  When it comes time to do the reboot, the mud checks
how long it has been running.  If it has been running less than 18 
hours and the reboot time has not been set manually, the reboot does
not take place (nor do the automatic warning echoes).

Echoes: when a scheduled reboot is coming up, the mud will send out
echoes to that effect.  The echoes start 30 minutes before the reboot
and are repeated at t minus 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 minute(s).

&gClass Type: &bForce &wPrestige Class

&gMax Level: &w10

&gDescription: &wThe Sith acolyte is a Force-using adherent of the Sith tradition. Descended from a rogue Jedi faction, the Sith
tradition has dominated their corner of the galaxy for millenia. Sith acolytes come and go as many perish and few get promoted.
Every Sith acolyte delves deep into the mysteries of the Sith, learning how to wield the Force in ways that draw upon the dark side.
They are dark sorcerers and fell priests, practitioners of living sacrifices and base deception. They come to the Sith tradition
from the ranks of the Force adepts and the dark side devotees. People who become Sith acolytes often do so simply out of naked
ambition. The Sith path teaches the power of the dark side of the Force, and such a weapon is often irresistible to those without
power of their own. Victims and subordinates make excellent Sith acolytes. Those with more authority and control make even better
Sith acolytes. The Sith acolyte proceeds from a position of weakness, even within the ranks of the Sith. Sith warriors are far
more physically capable, the Sith Lords combine the best aspects of both the cultist and the warrior. Therefore the Sith acolyte
comes to rely on cunning and subterfuge, advancing more through assassination and betrayal than conquest and domination. For
those who perform well, the role of acolyte is only the beginning. For those who perform poorly, the dark side is a yawning abyss
of madness. The path of the Sith acolyte should never be traveled lightly.

&gRequirements: &wHitroll +3, See Force 6, Force-Sensitive, Alter, Sense, Reputation 4, Darkpoints 4

&gHitpoints: &wA Sith acolyte gains 1-8 hitpoints per level. The character's Constitution applies.

0 'SITH LORD'~
&gName: &wSith Lord

&gClass Type: &bForce &wPrestige Class

&gMax Level: &w10

&gDescription: &wThe Sith Lord is the pinnacle of the Sith tradition. His most sacred tasks include preserving the lord and glory of
the Sith and plotting their eventual ascendance to their place as rulers of the galaxy. The Sith Lord must allow nothing to stand
in the way of his goal: not all the forces of the &bRepublic&w military, nor the entirety of the Jedi Order. When the time comes,
the Sith Lord must be prepared to ruthlessly crush all opposition, leaving no traces behind. This has been the way of the Sith for
a thousand years. Most Sith Lords begin as Sith Acolytes or Sith warriors. The Sith Lord cultivates individuals with the potential
for both great power and great evil, training them from childhood, when possible, to be every bit as ruthless as he is himself. The
training can be better described as physical and mental torture, but it is designed to create someone strong, fast, cunning, and
deadly. The Sith Lord passes on his knowledge of the dark side of the Force, instilling in his apprentice both a lust for power and
a fear of failure. Arguably, only the truly ambitious or deeply twisted ever seek to become Sith Lords. Following the path of the
Sith dominates one's destiny, requiring a constant devotion to engineering the ascendance of the Sith. A Sith Lord cannot afford
the luxury of friends, mercy, or even rest. The dark side sustains him through decades of scheming and planning, of masterminding
plots subtle and grandiose.

&gRequirements: &wHitroll +6, Battlemind 6, Intimidate 8, Force-Sensitive, Control, Alter, Sense, Darkpoints = Wisdom

&gHitpoints: &wA Sith Lord gains 1-10 hitpoints per level. The character's Constitution applies.

0 'SITH WARRIOR'~
&gName: &wSith Warrior

&gClass Type: &bForce &wPrestige Class

&gMax Level: &w10

&gDescription: &wThe Sith warrior combines mastery with the power of the dark side to create a living embodiment of rage and savagery.
Physical conditioning and punishing discipline make the Sith warrior into a formidable opponent, and facility with the powers of
the dark side add a wicked barb to an otherwise deadly weapon. The Sith warrior is dedicated to the conquest and subjugation of
any obstacle to the Sith tradition. A single Sith warrior is usually more than a match for most Jedi. When Sith warriors gather in
numbers, the galaxy trembles. Where other Sith focus on plots and deceptions, the Sith warrior devotes himself to the art of 
violence. The two complement each other perfectly, with the Sith warrior often delivering the final blow to a foe laid low by the
machinations of a Sith acolyte or Sith Lord. When the plans of the Sith hinge on a crime boss or a senator or a military officer
dying a vicious death, the Sith warrior is in his element. His is the last face the enemies of the Sith ever see &g-&w if they see
him at all. The training of a Sith warrior is always one of deprivation and hardship. Mercy and forbearance create a weak weapon,
and such a weapon is useless. The Sith warrior is subjected to endless conditioning and drilling. Displays of fear and uncertainty
are rewarded with painful and educational punishment. Displays of strength and ruthlessness are rewarded with another day's 
survival. The Sith warrior learns to live for the precious few words of encouragement his master gives, and the dream that he will
one day stand atop a pile of slain Jedi. For the Sith warrior, battle is its own reward.

&gRequirements: &wHitroll +4, Battlemind 4, Intimidate 6, Force-Sensitive, Alter, Control, Reputation 4, Darkpoints 6

&gHitpoints: &wA Sith warrior gains 1-10 hitpoints per level. A character's Constitution applies.

0 SKYTRI S'KYTRI~
&gName: &wS'kytri

&gDescription: &wThe winged S'kytri hail from Skye. In their native tongue, "S'kytri" mean "&Ythe Windborn&w". The enlightened
beliefs of the &bJedi&w appealed to Klarymere, the S'kytri Patriarch. S'kytri seem more interested in protecting and nurturing 
their homeworld by treating it as a living, breathing entity. They are also afraid of losing their culture. Most S'kytri have
little use of technology, although contact with the rest of the galaxy has prompted some S'kytri to reluctantly adopt technology
designed to ease the quality of life. Although a mammalian species, S'kytri hatch from eggs. Clothing is unimportant to S'kytri,
for too much material creates unwanted wind resistance during flight. Males wear anklets bearing the insignia of their clans, and
both genders wear slight, close-fitting coverings.

&gPersonality: &wProud, independent, and headstrong. S'kytri take great stock in tradition and "old world" values. They deplore
violence but fight ably and courageously when threatened. They see themselves as inherently superior to species that are 
incapable of natural flight. Young adult S'kytri tend to be especially arrogant, defiant, and rebellious.

&gPhysical Description: &wS'kytri have thin, muscular physiques and attractive, chiseled features. Feathered wings grow from
their shoulder blades. Although physically strong, S'kytri have hollow bones and are much lighter than they seem at a glance. Adults
average 2 to 2.2 meters tall, and S'kytri under 1.9 meters tall are considered "short" by the species' standards. Male S'kytri
typically have pale blue skin, while females usually have light green skin. Less than one percent of the population is born with
reversed pigmentation; the S'kytri treat these hatchlings as abominations of nature and destroy them. Hair color ranges from
deep maroon to dusty yellow to moon-white.

&gHomeworld: &wSkye, a mountainous and temperate world located in the Marat system &g(&win the Outer Rim Territories&g)&w.

&gSpecies Traits: &w+2 Strength, -2 Constitution, -2 Wisdom
                Medium-Sized

0 SOLDIER SOLDIERS~
&gName: &wSoldier

&gClass Type: &wNon-Force Base Class

&gMax Level: &w20

&gDescription: &wSoldiers combine discipline with martial skills to become the best pure warriors in the galaxy. Soldiers can be
stalwart defenders of those in need, cruel marauders, or brave adventurers. They can be hired guns, noble champions, or cold-hearted
killers. They fight for glory, for honor, to right wrongs, to gain power, to acquire wealth, or simple for the thrill of battle.

&gBackground: &wMost soldiers come to the profession after receiving at least some amount of formal training from a military
organization, local militia, or private army. Some attend formal academies; others are self-taught and well tested. A soldier may
have taken up his weapon to escape a mundane life. Another may be following a proud family tradition. Soldiers in a particular unit
share a certain camaraderie, but most have nothing in common except battle prowess and the desire to apply it to a given situation.

&gAbilities: &wSince most combat in the Star Wars universe uses blasters and other ranged weapons, Dexterity is the soldier's most
important ability score, followed closely by Constitution and Strength. Don't underestimate the importance of Intelligence and Wisdom,
however, since many of a soldier's useful skills are based on these abilities.

&gHitpoints: &wSoldiers gain 1-10 hitpoints per level. The character's Constitution applies.

1 STRENGTH STR~
Strength (STR in your 'score') represents your character's physical power.
 
The most common concern with strength deals with how much your character
can carry.  For each additional point of strength  you gain an additional
amount of maximum carryable weight.  Any character with 20 strength can
carry 500kgs; Wookiees can have a maximum of 25 strength, and
can therefore carry up to 999kgs when their strength is at its maximum.
 
Strength also affects (among other things):
 
 - damage roll and hitroll; for each additional point of strength, each
   of these will increase
 
 - chances of success for bash, stun, bashdoor, shove and drag, and the
   ability to dual-wield heavier weapons
 
 - your max levels in classes where strength would naturally relate.

from all over the galaxy to visit them. They have natural inclinations toward astrogation and piloting. It is said that once a 
Sullustan has traveled a path, he or she never forgets it, even in hyperspace. This friendly, gregarious species enjoys interacting
with unique, unusual, and interesting beings. When &bRepublic&w scouts first visited their homeworld, the Sullustans embraced
the notions of space travel and a galaxywide civilization wholeheartedly. The Sullustan manufacturing company SoroSuub quickly
became one of the first non-Human-owned interstellar corporations. It remains one of the largest manufacturing conglomerates in
the galaxy. The company is so powerful that is has become the official government of Sullust. More than half of the planet's
population is on its payroll.

&gPersonality: &wSullustans tend to be pragmatic, pleasant, and fond of practical jokes.

&gPhysical Description: &wHumanoid with large round eyes, big ears, and jowls, the average Sullustan stands between 1.3 and 1.8
meters tall.

&gHomeworld: &wSullust, a volcanic technological world located in the Outer Rim Territories.

0 TECH SPECIALIST~
&gName: &wTech Specialist

&gClass Type: &wNon-Force Base Class

&gMax Level: &w20

&gDescription: &wTech specialists combine expert training with natural genius to reach the top of their chosen field. Tech specialists
can be dedicated physicians, curious scientists, brilliant technicians, or computer geniuses. They seek to help people or gain
knowledge, to create technical gadgets or develop new scientific theories.

&gBackground: &wMost tech specialists start out in decidedly unheroic careers. They train to reach the top of their chosen field,
eventually offering their services to an adventuring party. Unlike most of the other examples of heroic classes, the average tech
specialist can't wait to get back to his workshop or laboratory. He does what is necessary while it is necessary, but the call of
research and development make the tech specialist long to return to his primary profession.

&gAbilities: &wIntelligence, by far, is the most important ability for a tech specialist. Wisdom and Dexterity serve the tech 
specialist well, providing the ability to better perceive the world around him and to interact with it at an advanced level.

&gHitpoints: &wTech specialists gain 1-6 hitpoints per level. The character's Constitution applies.

0 TICK~
Many of the actions in the game are based upon interval timers, including
combat, most autonomous monster actions, hp/force/move regeneration, power
duration, weather, and area resetting.
 
Of these timers, the hp/force/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks in the game average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.
 
Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if there are no characters in
in the area; less often (15 minutes) if any characters are present.  Also
note that objects lying on the ground will not be regenerated if anyone
is in the area when it resets.
 
Area resets are indicated by 'squeaking noises' just prior to the reset.

0 TOGORIAN~
&gName: &wTogorian

&gDescription: &wEnormous carnivores built for combat, Togorians are predatory, fearless warriors known to the galaxy at large as
ruthless pirates. They prowl the shipping lanes and hyperspace routes in ragtag fleets, looking for easy plunder. They usually 
stick to the less-traveled routes, although a particularly successful pirate fleet will boldly attack major thoroughfares. The
&bRepublic&w has launched major campaigns to eradicate the Togorian threat, with mixed success. More than once, the &bRepublic&w
believed it had eliminated a Togorian pirate fleet, only to see the pirates resurface days or weeks later at full strength. Because
they lack the necessary skills to maintain their own ships, Togorians will often keep slaves who possess such talents. Togorian
males and females rarely interact with one another, with encounters between genders occurring only a few days each standard year.
Males prefer a nomadic way of life, wandering the plains of Togoria on domesticated flying lizards called mosgoths. The females
spend their time in the cities, tending domesticated animals, and maintaing their society's solar-based technology.

&gPersonality: &wBrutal, short-tempered, and trecherous, male Togorians respect only the strength of their betters. Like gladiators,
they savor any chance to face a worthy foe in melee combat, especially members of other powerful species &g(&wlike Wookiees&g)&w.
Female Togorians are no less vicious and domineering, but they are less inclined to wander the stars in active pursuit of conflict.

&gPhysical Description: &wMuscular bipeds, Togorians stand 2.5 meters tall on average. Thick fur covers their bodies and is usually
jet-black or striped black and orange. Their large hands have retractable razor-sharp claws, and their jade green eyes are capable
of discerning prey ever in poor light.

&gHomeworld: &wTogoria, a temperate Mid Rim world of sprawling savannas, great canyons &g(&wmany containing isolated cities&g)&w, and
dense forests.

&gSpecies Traits: &w+4 Strength, -2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, -2 Intelligence, -2 Wisdom

0 TOGRUTA~
&gName: &wTogruta

&gDescription: &wEvolved from pack creatures, Togrutas are effective hunters and work well in large groups. Togruta society considers
overt independence a sign of mild deviance and consequently discourages individuality. Paradoxically, Togrutas who rise to 
positions of prominence generally do so by judiciously exercising their individualism. Outsiders see this as a sign of the ongoing
social evolution of the Togruta people. All Togrutas are marked by colorful skin patterns, a holdover from their days as dangerous,
stalking predators. The wild scrublands of their homeworld are covered with meter-high &Yturu-grass&w, which is red on one side and
white on the other. Primitive Togrutas would slink through the turu-grass using their highly developed sense of space and distance
to encircle unsuspecting herbivores.

&gPersonality: &wAs noted above, Togruta society discourages independence, and yet many Togrutas have gained power and prestige
through individuality. Togrutas are social, forthright, perceptive, and attentive.

&gPhysical Description: &wStriped, curved horns rise from the top of a Togruta's head. A pair of darker-striped head-tails &g(&wsimilar
to Twi'lek lekku&g)&w frame an oval face set with black, penetrating eyes and grayish lips. A Togruta's face features elaborate
red and white patterns. Vertical red and white stripes adorn the Togruta's chest, back, arms, and legs. Togruta adults stand
between 1.5 and 1.9 meters tall.

&gHomeworld: &wShili, a temperate wilderness planet located in the Expansion Region. The Togrutas live in small communities hidden
beneath forest canopies or tucked away in hidden valleys.

0 TRANDOSHAN TRANDOSHA DOSHA~
&gName: &wTrandoshan

&gDescription: &wTrandoshans are strong, reptilian, warlike humanoids from an arid world that orbits the same star as the lush Wookiee
homeworld. Bad blood exists between the two species for many reasons. The Trandoshans tried to colonize regions of the Wookiee
homeworld and were driven back following numerous bloody skirmishes. The influx of tourists from other systems also worried the 
Wookiees, who started realizing the negative impact on their planet's delicate ecosystem. They created laws restricting the number
of tourists allowed to visit their homeworld, which greatly reduced the number of tourists to the system and infuriated Trandoshans
eager to profit from the tourist trade. Trandoshans value hunting above all else and worship a female deity who rewards Trandoshans
baed on their success or failure in the hunt. Young Trandoshans hatch from eggs and ahve the ability to regenerate lost limbs.
Trandoshans lose their regenerative ability once they become young adults. Trandoshans refer to themselves as "&YT'doshok&w."

&gPersonality: &wTrandoshans are aggressive, selfish, and vindictive beings. Violent, brutal, and driven, they love to compete,
but can show compassion and mercy when the situation warrants. They like to collect trophies from various successful hunts, and
they generally value credits more than friendship, although a Trandoshan will pledge his life to protect another being who has 
saved him from certain death.

&gPhysical Description: &wTrandoshans range from 1.5 to 2.1 meters tall. Their scaly hides offer additonal defense against attacks
and range in color from sandy brown to glossy green.

&gHomeworld: &wTrandosha &g(&walso called Hsskor or Dosha&g)&w, an arid planet located in the Mid Rim. The planet orbits the same sun as
Kashyyyk, the Wookiee homeworld.

0 TWI'LEK TWI'LEKS TWILEK~
&gName: &wTwi'lek

&gDescription: &wTwi'leks are tall, thin humanoids native to the Ryloth star system in the Outer Rim. The species includes a 
variety of distinct subraces, but all are instantly recognizable by the tentacular "head-tails" that protrude from the backs of
their heads. Their native technology is primitive by galactic standards, and while they haven't developed their own means of space
travel, they are common sights on many Outer Rim planets. Sly, cunning beings, Twi'leks frequently consort with people from various
"walks of life," including legitimate merchants, temperamental mercenaries, dangerous pirates, and wanted slavers. Their 
entrepreneurial spirit frequently leads them to positions of influence, and Twi'lek corporate executives and ambassadors are no
less common than unscrupulous Twi'lek freighter captains and crime lords.
&gPersonality: &wTwi'leks are calculating, pragmatic, and charismatic people. Generally speaking, they try to avoid being swept
up in other beings' troubles, preferring instead to duck into the shadows and wait out large conflicts. From a safe hiding place,
they can observe, plan, and prepare to profit from the outcome.

&gPhysical Description: &wHumanoid, with long tapered head-tails, the average Twi'lek stands between 1.6 and 2.1 meters tall. Skin
tones include shades of blue, white, and green.

0 UBESE~
&gName: &wUbese

&gDescription: &wFew beings know what an Ubese looks like, for members of the species rarely, if ever, appear before non-Ubese without
their masks, battle armor, or environmental suits. When away from their homeworlds, Ubese warap themselves from head to toe in 
battle armor, environmental suits, or flowing robes. &g(&wTrue Ubese must wear protective gear when venturing into the radioactive
wastes of their world.&g)&w Their masks and helmets are fitted with voice modulators that clarify and amplify their natural speech.

&gPersonality: &wThe hatred that the &Yyrak pootzck&w and "true" Ubese share for other species unites them. They typically make
their living as mercenaries, bounty hunters, slavers, or assassins &g- &w professions where they get to vent their hatred without
fear of retibution. Although they take great pains to conceal their true appearance, the Ubese do not bother to hide their
vindictive dispositions.

&gPhysical Description: &wUbese have slight builds, appearing almost frail. They tend to have fair skin and dark hair, with eye
colors of brilliant green or blue. They have no body or facial hair. Their facial structure tends to be narrow, with high cheekbones
and eyes that appear much too large for their faces. Males and females of the species both stand roughly the same height, with
males being only slightly heavier of build than females. Adults stand between 1.4 and 2.2 meters tall.

&gHomeworld: &wUba 111, located in the Mid Rim Territories.

0 UMBARAN~
&gNames: &wUmbaran

&gDescription: &wUmbarans hail from a gloomy corner of the galaxy called the Ghost Nebula. Although present since the dawn of the
&bRepublic&w, Umbarans have rarely been encountered in great numbers. They drift like specters through Senate corridors and various
chambers of power, respected and oftentimes feared for their ability to subtly influence others. Speculation abounds that all 
Umbarans are Force-users who use the Force to probe and control minds. Others simply view the Umbarans as perceptive, silver-tongued
opportunists.

&gPersonality: &wUmbarans are secretive, manipulative, and inscrutable beings who crave power and influence. They are masters of
obfuscation and misdirection, seldom revealing their true thoughts. They have a dark sense of humor that occasionally manifests 
in social situtations.

NOTE: It could be quite dangerous to unfold an area that is already loaded,
      or one that has not been tested.
~

1 USE ACTIVATE~

1 'USE COMPUTER'~
&GName: &w&WUse Computer

&GSyntax: &w&WAutomatic when using computer systems

&GSkill Type: &w&WNon-Force Skill

&GDescription: &w&WUse this skill to access computer systems and write or modify computer programs, to
reprogram droids, and to override or bypass computer-controlled devices.
~

31 USEPROG~
Syntax: opedit <object> <command> [number] [use_prog] [percentage]
 
The use_prog is an objtrigger that can be used in object programs.  The
use_prog will be executed when the item is used.  To define what will
trigger the use_prog, here is a list:

* Wands - when you zap
* Staves - when you brandish
* Food/pills - when you eat
* Blood/fountains/drink containers - when you drink
* Lights/armour/weapons - when you wear/wield/hold
* Potions - when you quaff
* Pipes - when you smoke
 
When the use_prog is executed you will not see the standard 'use message'
(ie You quaff a violet potion). What you will will be any mpechoes placed
in the program.  Also, any mobprog commands can be used in use_prog (see 
MPCOMMANDS).

**NOTE** The use_progs on lights, armour, and weapons are executed BEFORE
the player wears/holds/wields any item. Therefore, a mpforce to remove the
item will not work in the use_prog.  You will have to use a wear trigger
to accomplish this.
~

31 USERS~
Syntax: users <host ip>
Syntax: users <playername>

USERS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including users
in the process of logging in.
If used with an argument, it will show all users from that host ip.
Shortforms of host will work -- e.x. 205, or 205.113, etc.
Shortened names will also work.  e.x., users fre would show
Fredrick and Fred if they were on at the time.
The first number, (desc), is the descriptor number that this user is on.
The second number is the user's connected state.  (See CONSTATES)
The third number is the number of seconds the user has been idle.
The fourth number is the remote TCP port on the user's host machine.
Next is the user's character name, then the user's host address.
(Usually the IP number as name resolving is normally disabled.)

The FORCECLOSE command can be used to force a connect to close by its
descriptor number.

0 VERPINE ROCHE "ROCHE ASTROID FIELD"~
&gName: &wVerpine

&gDescription: &wThe Verpine have been spacefarers for their entire recorded history and for untold centuries longer than they have
had contact with other species. Like a handful of other ancient spacefaring species, their world of origin is unknown even to
themselves. Verpine society is based around absolute majority rule. At home in the Roche asteroid belt, they use their natural
telecommunication ability to poll every Verpine in the system about every governmental initiative, and because everyone has a
voice, everyone considers the final decisions completely binding. Other Verpine communities tend to use a similar method of
arriving at decisions; therefore, every Verpine in a community is able to speak with complete authority about his community's
stance on an issue.Verpine engineers could be found at nearly every major shipyard and spaceport.

&gPersonality: &wTechnology fascinates the Verpine. The average Verpine isn't likely to risk "life and limb" for a political
cause that has no measurable impact on Verpine society but will throw himself in the path of a blaster bolt to protect a valuable
piece of technology, such as a customized droid or personalized toolkit.

&gPhysical Description: &wThe Verpine have sticklike bodies covered in plates of flexible, brilliant-green chitin. They possess
two arms and two legs, each of which ends in two fingers and an opposable thumb. Their large black eyes allow them to see even
microscopic details, and the two antennae that extend from the backs of their heads allow them to communicate with one another
over great distances by creating natural radio waves. Adult Verpine stand between 1.8 and 2 meters tall.

&gHomeworld: &wThe largest settlement of Verpine in the galaxy lies in the Roche asteroid field, located in the Expansion Region.
The Verpine rely on technology to generate atmospheres and gravity within hollowed-out chunks of rock.

voting with 'note vote <number> open'.  All those who can read the
board may then vote on the issue in the note with 'note vote <number>
yes/no/abstain'. The author may close the voting; the syntax for that
should be clear enough.

recipient in 'note list' will be a colon, a capital V or a capital C
accordingly.

0 WEEQUAY~
&gName: &wWeequay

&gDescription: &wWeequay are vicious warriors with no concept of individuality. They worship a pantheon of deities, chief among them
the god of the moon, Quay. The species' name translates as "Follower of Quay," and Weequay warriors honor Quay with ritual sacrifices
and bloody murders. They also erect shrines of black stone, called &Ythals&w, to honor their gods. Although primitive by galactic
standards, they are capable crafters. The Weequay had achieved an industrial level of technology before making contact with the 
rest of the galaxy. Male Weequay grow a new braid each year they're away from their homeworld and shave it off when they return,
even if only briefly.

&gPersonality: &wWeequay are brooding, superstitious beings prone to violence. Weequay lack individual names, referring to themselves
simply as "Weequay," though they will answer to names given to them by others they trust. They rarely talk, even among their own
kind.

&gPhysical Description: &wHumanoid, with leathery skin, a flat nose, lipless mouth and a bony frill along each jowl, the average
Weequay stands about 1.7 meters tall. Male Weequay have one or more long dark braids of hair collected into a topknot. Female 
Weequay are completely bald.

&gHomeworld: &wSriluur, a semi-arid world on the periphery of Hutt Space in the Outer Rim. Weequay originally roamed the deserts of
Sriluur to avoid predators. As their technology advanced to an industrial level, makeshift cities began to form near the ocean
shores. These cities provided much-needed protection from Sriluur's predators and access to its bountiful seas.

&gSpecies Traits: &w+2 Strength, +2 Constitution, -2 Intelligence, -2 Wisdom, -4 Charisma

&gName: &wWookiee

&gDescription: &wWookiees are widely recognized as one of the strongest and fiercest intelligent species in the galaxy, but their
homeworld of Kashyyyk has predators so powerful that the Wookiees must live in the tops of the world's giant &Ywroshyr&w trees.
When the &bRepublic&w first made contact with Kashyyyk, the Wookiees were engaged in a war against the Trandoshans. The &bRepublic&w
mediated the dispute, and the Wookiees eagerly joined the galactic community. Wookiees have a great many customs and traditions
that revolve around honor and loyalty, including the special bond of friendship called the honor family, and the sacred pledge 
of honor called the life debt. Though arboreal, a Wookiee never uses his or her climbing claws in combat; doing this is considered
dishonorable and a sign of madness.

&gPersonality: &wWhile Wookiees have a well-deserved reputation for hostility &g(&wsuch as pulling arms off droids and ears off
gundarks&g)&w, they also possess a great capacity for kindness. Wookiees tend to be honorable, rash, loyal, and short-tempered.

0 WOOSTOID~
&gName: &wWoostoid

&gDescription: &wWoostoids are slender humanoids whose logical minds give them a natural affinity for computer technology and database
management. Woostoids are often found at the head of bureaucracies devoted to the collection and analyzing of data, and Woostri
&g(&wtheir homeworld&g) &wis the single largest repository of &bRepublic&w databases. One of the acknowledged Wonders of the Galaxy, the
HoloScan Database, is located on Woostri. It is the most complete research facility known to exist, a huge complex thousands of
kilometers across and hundreds of stories high. For a few credits per visit, the Woostoids and their computers can locate information
on everything from the latest members of the Senate to pre-Republic civilizations within a matter of minutes.

&gPersonality: &wWoostoids are a peaceful species in the extreme &g- &wthey find even the concept of warfare frightening. Their
minds work in such a way that they always think of situations in an orderly manner, trying to create logical ties between events.
When presented with chaotic situations or facts that have no logical pattern, they become confused and disoriented.

&gPhysical Description: &wWoostoids have dark orange skin and thick red hair. They have large, bulbous black eyes that rarely blink.
Traditionally, they wear long flowing robes of shiny, bright-colored materials. Adult Woostoids stand between 1.5 and 2 meters tall.

0 YEVETHA~
a humanoid alien race which resemble skeletons. Their facial structure is
highly colored, with a white nasal ridge and scarlet cheek and chin ridges
surrounding dark black eyes. The Yevetha have six clawed fingers on each
hand, and a wicked  dewclaw could be extended from their wrists. They are
a very self-important race, and consider all other races to be vermin. The
Yevetha have a hierarchical society, with the males being dominant. There
are castes of males and females,  and the higher classes alway dominate
the lower. Lower-ranking Yevethan males must bear their necks in
deferrence to their superiors. Yevetha are also extrememly quick to learn
about new things, and are particularly adept at  assimilating technology.
They never eat in mixed company, and detest the smell and feel of other
races. They have installed specialized bathing stations on their embassy
ships, to wash away the scent of other races. The Yevetha come  from the
planet N'zoth.

0 ZELTRON~
&gName: &wZeltron

&gDescription: &wZeltrons are known the galaxy over as unabashed hedonists. All members of the species encourage the pursuit of
pleasure in all its forms. Known as the most fun-loving and convivial species in the galaxy, the Zeltrons take recreation and the
pursuit of pleasure to new heights. Because of their popularity and lives spent pursuing gratification, Zeltrons are common
throughout the galaxy, particularly at spaceports where they can find many prospective mates. Since many Zeltrons also love gambling,
these locations serve two purposes for them. For lonely spacefarers living on the fringe and others who find lasting companionship
elusive, the ever-willing Zeltrons provide a welcome respite. Zeltron technology is on par with most spacefaring worlds. The
Zeltrons possess space travel, advanced agricultural and industrial methods, and excellent knowledge of medicine. Zeltron artists
are renowned for their erotic sculptures, paintings, and other works of art. Zeltron courtesans, known as &Ycriblez&w, fulfill any
physical desire one might have, without limits. Many crime lords, particularly Hutts, have taken special interest in these Zeltron
events.

&gPersonality: &wGregarious, warm, lustful, and merry, Zeltrons love parties and people. Zeltrons who reach old age or endure great
travails or suffering often manifest different peronality traits: a deep melancholy, a fervent passion for justice or a cause, or
an intense loneliness and desire for a lasting bond.

&gPhysical Description: &wZeltrons are near-Humans with skin colors ranging from pink to crimson. Nearly all are considered &g(&wby Human
standards&g)&w shockingly beautiful and handsome. Zeltrons average 1.8 meters tall.

&gHomeworld: &wZeltros, an idyllic planet located on the edge of the Outer Rim and the Unknown Regions.
