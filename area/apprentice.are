It Gets no cleaner walking through here. The ground seems to

A Hazey mist is starting to fill the area from the fire pit
just up ahead. More light is given into an otherwise desolet
area.Scraps of metal litter the area now. A rawk-bat flys over
head almost dangerously close. Who new they flew this low?

A Roughly-Hewn Wroshyr Platform~
One of the massive wroshyr trees populating the jungle ecosystem
of the planet Kashyyyk has been split horizontally and used
as a makeshift landing platform.  The thick, palpable scent of
tree sap pushes at the senses, causing a temporary override
to motor skills, but thankfully there are vine nets surrounding
the edge, preventing a disasterous fall.  Wookiee technicians
meander about, tinkering with ships and ordering those entering
the vicinity to preset areas.

Underneath the Platform~
Hideously tangled among the vine nets gathered underneath the
landing zone lies an motley assortment of items.  Amidst the various
junk there may exist something worthwhile, but it would take an
extensive search that would be both time-consuming and precarious.
Fluttering bits of web intertwine the nets, capturing more useless
objects than creatures of real nutritional value.

Here is where questionable individuals are escorted from the

are surrounded quickly by Wookiee guards and placed here for
observation and questioning.  The Wookiee people, having learned
from the past mistake of trusting too easily, work now to prevent
sabotage and malignancy from invading their home.

Traversing the Wroshyr Branch~
Slender, as far wroshyr branches are considered, this avenue
stretches only fifty meters across.  The traffic is sparse, and
the few Wookiees that do take it upon themselves to travel here
vary in greatly size, shape and color.  Tufts of fog curl around
the edges of the branch, making for difficult peripheral vision.

As the Wookiee city looms closer, the flow of traffic increases.
From this distance, the three levels of populated wroshyr can be
seen clearly through occasional wisps of fog.  For a minor city
on Kashyyyk, Lyynark seems to be thriving.  Wookiee citizens crawl
up and down the branches between levels, using vine elevators
for non-arboreal beings and supplies.
