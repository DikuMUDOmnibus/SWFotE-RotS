ALL MOBs/OBJs are to have descriptions. No exceptions. Above
and beyond this, ALL MOBs are to be equipped and/or dressed.Remember,
we are striving to be far more unique, original, and advanced
than any other SWR that has existed. Furthermore, it doesn't
quite make sense to attempt a realistic look at every aspect
of the MUD and then leave the 'citizens' (MOBs) naked and unarmed.As
far as descriptions go, if you create an object such as a rock...it
needs a description. Describe it's shape, what it may be made
of, it's age, color, texture, blah blah blah. More advanced
OBJs (technologically speaking) should be of course, much more
discriptive than a rock or something similiar. A weapon? State
that the marks along it's handle imply that it was made by so
and so.You get the gist. Any questions, ask. If you've got writer's-block
and can't quite come up w/ anything, ask. I'll be more than
happy to help.

I'm looking for ideas concerning what should/should not be put into the Coruscant
(and other planet's) Employment Opportunities Centers. I want to steer away from the 
typical stock options that you see on most SWRs. Let me know what you think.

I'm thinking we should add 'scant to the senate. The level of
Supreme Chancellor seems (it really is) an elected position
of ALL the senators. Thus, 'scant MUST have a Senator. Agree,
disagree?

1492 goes to 1495. 1491 goes to 1496. If possible (if it's too
much work, screw it) can you make the ships go THROUGH another
vnum or two? like actually traveling there instead of just being
transferred there? it'd be more realistic, plus, if you're in
one of those rooms, you'd see 'A ship is transported in from
the west' or something, then 'A ship is transported to the east'
blahblahblah. lemme know.

if you can do so, the path is from 1492, to 1498, to 1494, then
finally to the hanger at 1495. the 2nd is from 1491 to 1490
to 1497 to finally, 1496.

Help Crystaltypes

This file will show you the various crystals we have implemented, more will come as I have
ideas or as they are suggested. You cannot vary from the way they are set, just set the color
and the code will do the rest. Only 1 type of each crystal may be used and one of the 3 crystals used
MUST be a color crystal or else it will be destroyed and the crystals will be lost.
